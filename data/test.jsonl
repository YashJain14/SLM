You need to replay your fixes on top of that latest work from upstream to make sure your commits are still compatible with the latest of upstream.\n\nThe OP Santosh Kumar asks in the comments:\n\nI have pulled and merged from upstream to master, now what? \n\nIf you haven't made any new fixes since your recent pull request, see above (delete and recreate an new branch fix on top of your updated master).\nIf you have done any more work since your pull request, I wouldn't merge from upstream if I want to make a new pull request: I would pull and rebase:\ngit pull --rebase upstream master\n\nThat way, all my new local work is replayed on top of the most recent upstream master commits (fetched in my local repo), supposing that master is the target branch that will integrate my future pull request.\nThen I can push my local work to 'origin', which is my fork on GitHub of upstream.\nAnd from my fork on GitHub, I can safely make a pull request, knowing that it will only add new commits to upstream without needing any merge resolution: merging those new commits in upstream repo will mean a simple fast-forward merge.\n\nA git pull --rebase without specifying the branch on top of which you want to rebase your (currently checked out) fix branch wouldn't work:\n\nThat (git pull --rebase) says: \n\nYou asked to pull from the remote '`upstream`', but did not specify a branch. \n\n\nShould I append master at last?

We want to clean up these commits by squashing many down into a single commit. Naturally, git-rebase seems the way to go. My problem is that it ends up with merge conflicts, and these conflicts are not easy to resolve. I don't understand why there should be any conflicts at all, since I'm just squashing commits (not deleting or rearranging). Very likely, this demonstrates that I'm not completely understanding how git-rebase does its squashes.\nHere's a modified version of the scripts I'm using:\n\nrepo_squash.sh (this is the script that is actually run):\n\nrm -rf repo_squash\ngit clone repo repo_squash\ncd repo_squash/\nGIT_EDITOR=../repo_squash_helper.sh git rebase --strategy theirs -i bd6a09a484b8230d0810e6689cf08a24f26f287a\n\n\nrepo_squash_helper.sh (this script is used only by repo_squash.sh):\n\nif grep -q \"pick \" $1\nthen\n#  cp $1 ../repo_squash_history.txt\n#  emacs -nw $1\n  sed -f ../repo_squash_list.txt < $1 > $1.tmp\n  mv $1.tmp $1\nelse\n  if grep -q \"initial import\" $1\n  then\n    cp ../repo_squash_new_message1.txt $1\n  elif grep -q \"fixing bad import\" $1\n  then\n    cp ../repo_squash_new_message2.txt $1\n  else\n    emacs -nw $1\n  fi\nfi\n\n\nrepo_squash_list.txt: (this file is used only by repo_squash_helper.sh)\n\n# Initial import\ns/pick \\(251a190\\)/squash \\1/g\n# Leaving \"Needed subdir\" for now\n# Fixing bad import\ns/pick \\(46c41d1\\)/squash \\1/g\ns/pick \\(5d7agf2\\)/squash \\1/g\ns/pick \\(3da63ed\\)/squash \\1/g\n\n\nI'll leave the \"new message\" contents to your imagination. Initially, I did this without the \"--strategy theirs\" option (i.e., using the default strategy, which if I understand the documentation correctly is recursive, but I'm not sure which recursive strategy is used), and it also didn't work. Also, I should point out that, using the commented out code in repo_squash_helper.sh, I saved off the original file that the sed script works on and ran the sed script against it to make sure it was doing what I wanted it to do (it was). Again, I don't even know why there would be a conflict, so it wouldn't seem to matter so much which strategy is used. Any advice or insight would be helpful, but mostly I just want to get this squashing working.\nUpdated with extra information from discussion with Jefromi:\nBefore working on our massive \"real\" repository, I used similar scripts on a test repository. It was a very simple repository and the test worked cleanly.\nThe message I get when it fails is:\nFinished one cherry-pick.\n# Not currently on any branch.\nnothing to commit (working directory clean)\nCould not apply 66c45e2...

If I do it yet again, this time it goes through about a hundred commits, and yields this message:\nAutomatic cherry-pick failed.  After resolving the conflicts,\nmark the corrected paths with 'git add <paths>', and\nrun 'git rebase --continue'\nCould not apply f1de3bc... Incremental\n\nIf I then run git status, I get:\n# Not currently on any branch.\n# Changes to be committed:\n#   (use \"git reset HEAD <file>...\" to unstage)\n#\n# modified:   repo/file_A.cpp\n# modified:   repo/file_B.cpp\n#\n# Unmerged paths:\n#   (use \"git reset HEAD <file>...\" to unstage)\n#   (use \"git add/rm <file>...\" as appropriate to mark resolution)\n#\n# both modified:      repo/file_X.cpp\n#\n# Changed but not updated:\n#   (use \"git add/rm <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n#   (use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n#\n# deleted:    repo/file_Z.imp\n\nThe \"both modified\" bit sounds weird to me, since this was just the result of a pick. It's also worth noting that if I look at the \"conflict\", it boils down to a single line with one version beginning it with a [tab] character, and the other one with four spaces. This sounded like it might be an issue with how I've set up my config file, but there's nothing of the sort in it. (I did note that core.ignorecase is set to true, but evidently git-clone did that automatically. I'm not completely surprised by that considering that the original source was on a Windows machine.)\nIf I manually fix file_X.cpp, it then fails shortly afterward with another conflict, this time between a file (CMakeLists.txt) that one version thinks should exist and one version thinks shouldn't. If I fix this conflict by saying I do want this file (which I do), a few commits later I get another conflict (in this same file) where now there's some rather non-trivial changes. It's still only about 25% of the way through the conflicts.\nI should also point out, since this might be very important, that this project started out in an svn repository. That initial history very likely was imported from that svn repository.\nUpdate #2:\nOn a lark (influenced by Jefromi's comments), I decided to do the change my repo_squash.sh to be:\nrm -rf repo_squash\ngit clone repo repo_squash\ncd repo_squash/\ngit rebase --strategy theirs -i bd6a09a484b8230d0810e6689cf08a24f26f287a\n\nAnd then, I just accepted the original entries, as is. I.e., the \"rebase\" shouldn't have changed a thing. It ended up with the same results describe previously.\nUpdate #3:\nAlternatively, if I omit the strategy and replace the last command with:\ngit rebase -i bd6a09a484b8230d0810e6689cf08a24f26f287a\n\nI no longer get the \"nothing to commit\" rebase problems, but I'm still left with the other conflicts.\nUpdate with toy repository that recreates problem:\ntest_squash.sh (this is the file you actually run):\n#========================================================\n# Initialize directories\n#========================================================\nrm -rf test_squash/ test_squash_clone/\nmkdir -p test_squash\nmkdir -p test_squash_clone\n#========================================================\n\n#========================================================\n# Create repository with history\n#========================================================\ncd test_squash/\ngit init\necho \"README\">README\ngit add README\ngit commit -m\"Initial commit: can't easily access for rebasing\"\necho \"Line 1\">test_file.txt\ngit add test_file.txt\ngit commit -m\"Created single line file\"\necho \"Line 2\">>test_file.txt \ngit add test_file.txt \ngit commit -m\"Meant for it to be two lines\"\ngit checkout -b dev\necho Meaningful code>new_file.txt\ngit add new_file.txt \ngit commit -m\"Meaningful commit\"\ngit checkout master\necho Conflicting meaningful code>new_file.txt\ngit add new_file.txt \ngit commit -m\"Conflicting meaningful commit\"\n# This will conflict\ngit merge dev\n# Fixes conflict\necho Merged meaningful code>new_file.txt\ngit add new_file.txt\ngit commit -m\"Merged dev with master\"\ncd ..\n\n#========================================================\n# Save off a clone of the repository prior to squashing\n#========================================================\ngit clone test_squash test_squash_clone\n#========================================================\n\n#========================================================\n# Do the squash\n#========================================================\ncd test_squash\nGIT_EDITOR=../test_squash_helper.sh git rebase -i HEAD@{7}\n#========================================================\n\n#========================================================\n# Show the results\n#========================================================\ngit log\ngit gc\ngit reflog\n#========================================================\n\ntest_squash_helper.sh (used by test_sqash.sh):\n# If the file has the phrase \"pick \" in it, assume it's the log file\nif grep -q \"pick \" $1\nthen\n  sed -e \"s/pick \\(.*\\) \\(Meant for it to be two lines\\)/squash \\1 \\2/g\" < $1 > $1.tmp\n  mv $1.tmp $1\n# Else, assume it's the commit message file\nelse\n# Use our pre-canned message\n  echo \"Created two line file\" > $1\nfi\n\nP.S.: Yes, I know some of you cringe when you see me using emacs as a fall-back editor.\nP.P.S.: We do know we'll have to blow away all of our clones of the existing repository after the rebase.

As explained by the official Linux Kernel Git documentation for specifying Git revisions, HEAD is a special shortcut reference for the commit that you currently have checked-out as your working copy (or in Git terms, your \"working tree\"):\n\nHEAD names the commit on which you based the changes in the working tree.\n\nYou can also read these other Stack Overflow questions on what the special reference HEAD means:\n\nHEAD and ORIG_HEAD in Git.\nWhat is git HEAD, exactly?.\n\nVonC also found interesting information about why @ was chosen as a shortcut for head in this Stack Overflow answer (the last section at the bottom).\nNote that like it often happens with Git, while @ is a convenient shortcut, it isn't always a valid replacement for HEAD. Example:\n$ git bundle create temp.bundle @\nEnumerating objects: 25, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (25/25), done.\nCompressing objects: 100% (20/20), done.\nTotal 25 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\n\n$ git bundle list-heads temp.bundle\nc006e049da432677d1a27f0eba661671e0524710 refs/heads/master\n\n$ git bundle create temp.bundle HEAD\nEnumerating objects: 25, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (25/25), done.\nCompressing objects: 100% (20/20), done.\nTotal 25 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\n\n$ git bundle list-heads temp.bundle\nc006e049da432677d1a27f0eba661671e0524710 HEAD\n\nIn this case, using @ is more like a replacement for master (the branch that HEAD happened to be pointing to) rather than for HEAD. If you try to fetch from the resulting bundle later, you'll have to specify the ref you want to fetch (master) if you used @, and you won't have to to it if you specified HEAD explicitly."}]}

The Microsoft.NET.Sdk (meaning you must be using an sdk-style project) now includes support for adding the commit hash to both the assembly informational version as well as to the nuget package metadata, if some conditions are met:\n\nThe <SourceRevisionId> property must be defined. This can be done by adding a target like this:\n\n<Target Name=\"SetSourceRevisionId\" BeforeTargets=\"InitializeSourceControlInformation\">\n    <Exec \n      Command=\"git describe --long --always --dirty --exclude=* --abbrev=8\"\n      ConsoleToMSBuild=\"True\"\n      IgnoreExitCode=\"False\"\n      >\n      <Output PropertyName=\"SourceRevisionId\" TaskParameter=\"ConsoleOutput\"/>\n    </Exec>\n  </Target>\n\n\nThis target executes a command that will set SourceRevisionId to be the abbreviated (8 character) hash. The BeforeTargets causes this to be run before the assembly informational version is created.\n\nTo include the hash in the nuget package metadata, the <RepositoryUrl> must also be defined.\n\n<SourceControlInformationFeatureSupported> property must be true, this causes the nuget pack task to pick up the SourceRevisionId as well.\n\n\nI would steer people away from using the MSBuildGitHash package, since this new technique is cleaner and most consistent.\nORIGINAL:\nI've created a simple nuget package that you can include in your project which will take care of this for you: https://www.nuget.org/packages/MSBuildGitHash/\nThis nuget package implements a \"pure\" MSBuild solution. If you'd rather not depend on a nuget package you can simply copy these Targets into your csproj file and it should include the git hash as a custom assembly attribute:\n<Target Name=\"GetGitHash\" BeforeTargets=\"WriteGitHash\" Condition=\"'$(BuildHash)' == ''\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <!-- temp file for the git version (lives in \"obj\" folder)-->\n    <VerFile>$(IntermediateOutputPath)gitver</VerFile>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <!-- write the hash to the temp file.-->\n  <Exec Command=\"git -C $(ProjectDir) describe --long --always --dirty &gt; $(VerFile)\" />\n\n  <!-- read the version into the GitVersion itemGroup-->\n  <ReadLinesFromFile File=\"$(VerFile)\">\n    <Output TaskParameter=\"Lines\" ItemName=\"GitVersion\" />\n  </ReadLinesFromFile>\n  <!-- Set the BuildHash property to contain the GitVersion, if it wasn't already set.-->\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <BuildHash>@(GitVersion)</BuildHash>\n  </PropertyGroup>    \n</Target>\n\n<Target Name=\"WriteGitHash\" BeforeTargets=\"CoreCompile\">\n  <!-- names the obj/.../CustomAssemblyInfo.cs file -->\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <CustomAssemblyInfoFile>$(IntermediateOutputPath)CustomAssemblyInfo.cs</CustomAssemblyInfoFile>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n  <!-- includes the CustomAssemblyInfo for compilation into your project -->\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <Compile Include=\"$(CustomAssemblyInfoFile)\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n  <!-- defines the AssemblyMetadata attribute that will be written -->\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <AssemblyAttributes Include=\"AssemblyMetadata\">\n      <_Parameter1>GitHash</_Parameter1>\n      <_Parameter2>$(BuildHash)</_Parameter2>\n    </AssemblyAttributes>\n  </ItemGroup>\n  <!-- writes the attribute to the customAssemblyInfo file -->\n  <WriteCodeFragment Language=\"C#\" OutputFile=\"$(CustomAssemblyInfoFile)\" AssemblyAttributes=\"@(AssemblyAttributes)\" />\n</Target>\n\nThere are two targets here. The first one, \"GetGitHash\", loads the git hash into an MSBuild property named BuildHash, it only does this if BuildHash is not already defined. This allows you to pass it to MSBuild on the command line, if you prefer. You could pass it to MSBuild like so:\nMSBuild.exe myproj.csproj /p:BuildHash=MYHASHVAL\nThe second target, \"WriteGitHash\", will write the hash value to a file in the temporary \"obj\" folder named \"CustomAssemblyInfo.cs\". This file will contain a line that looks like:\n[assembly: AssemblyMetadata(\"GitHash\", \"MYHASHVAL\")]\nThis CustomAssemblyInfo.cs file will be compiled into your assembly, so you can use reflection to look for the AssemblyMetadata at runtime. The following code shows how this can be done when the AssemblyInfo class is included in the same assembly.\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Reflection;\n\npublic static class AssemblyInfo\n{\n    /// <summary> Gets the git hash value from the assembly\n    /// or null if it cannot be found. </summary>\n    public static string GetGitHash()\n    {\n        var asm = typeof(AssemblyInfo).Assembly;\n        var attrs = asm.GetCustomAttributes<AssemblyMetadataAttribute>();\n        return attrs.FirstOrDefault(a => a.Key == \"GitHash\")?.Value;\n    }\n}\n\nSome benefits to this design is that it doesn't touch any files in your project folder, all the mutated files are under the \"obj\" folder. Your project will also build identically from within Visual Studio or from the command line. It can also be easily customized for your project, and will be source controlled along with your csproj file."}]}

One particular issue holding me back is the inability to lock binary files. Throughout the past year I have yet to see developments on this issue.  I understand that locking files goes against the fundamental principles of distributed source control, but I don't see how a web development company can take advantage of git to track source code and image file changes when there is the potential for binary file conflicts.\nTo achieve the effects of locking, a \"central\" repository must be identified.  Regardless of the distributed nature of git, most companies will have a \"central\" repository for a software project.  We should be able to mark a file as requiring a lock from the governing git repository at a specified address.  Perhaps this is made difficult because git tracks file contents not files?\nDo any of you have experience in dealing with git and binary files that should be locked before modification?\nNOTE: It looks like Source Gear's new open source distributed version control project, Veracity, has locking as one of its goals."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Subversion has locks, and they aren't just advisory.

They are a much more effective method than push-notifications such as phone or e-mail. Subversion locks are self-documenting (who has the lock). On the other hand, if you have to communicate by other traditional push-notification channels, such as e-mail, who do you send the notification to? You don't know in advance who might want to edit the file, especially on open-source projects, unless you have a complete list of your entire development team. So those traditional communication methods aren't nearly as effective.\nA central lock server, while against the principles of DVCS, is the only feasible method for non-mergeable files. As long as DVCS don't have a central lock feature, I think it will keep the company I work for using Subversion.\nThe better solution would be to make a merge tool for all your binary file formats, but that's a longer-term and ongoing goal that will never be \"finished\".\nHere's an interesting read on the topic."}]}

Also, there's a real-world example in the walkthrough below.\n\nPrepare the old repo\n cd <big-repo>\n git subtree split -P <name-of-folder> -b <name-of-new-branch>\n\nNote: <name-of-folder> must NOT contain leading or trailing characters.  For instance, the folder named subproject MUST be passed as subproject, NOT ./subproject/\nNote: <name-of-new-branch> is a branch you will be creating in the existing/old repo, NOT the new one [that comes later].\nNote for Windows users: When your folder depth is > 1, <name-of-folder> must have *nix style folder separator (/). For instance, the folder named path1\\path2\\subproject MUST be passed as path1/path2/subproject\n\nCreate the new repo\n mkdir ~/<new-repo> && cd ~/<new-repo>\n git init\n git pull </path/to/big-repo> <name-of-new-branch>\n\n\nLink the new repo to GitHub or wherever\n git remote add origin <[email protected]:user/new-repo.git>\n git push -u origin master\n\n\nCleanup inside <big-repo>, if desired\n git rm -rf <name-of-folder>\n\nNote: This leaves all the historical references in the repository. See the Appendix below if you're actually concerned about having committed a password or you need to decreasing the file size of your .git folder.\n\n\n\nWalkthrough\nThese are the same steps as above, but following my exact steps for my repository instead of using <meta-named-things>.\nHere's a project I have for implementing JavaScript browser modules in node:\ntree ~/node-browser-compat\n\nnode-browser-compat\n├── ArrayBuffer\n├── Audio\n├── Blob\n├── FormData\n├── atob\n├── btoa\n├── location\n└── navigator\n\nI want to split out a single folder, btoa, into a separate Git repository\ncd ~/node-browser-compat/\ngit subtree split -P btoa -b btoa-only\n\nI now have a new branch, btoa-only, that only has commits for btoa and I want to create a new repository.\nmkdir ~/btoa/ && cd ~/btoa/\ngit init\ngit pull ~/node-browser-compat btoa-only\n\nNext, I create a new repo on GitHub or Bitbucket, or whatever and add it as the origin\ngit remote add origin [email protected]:node-browser-compat/btoa.git\ngit push -u origin master\n\nHappy day!\nNote: If you created a repo with a README.md, .gitignore and LICENSE, you will need to pull first:\ngit pull origin master\ngit push origin master\n\nLastly, I'll want to remove the folder from the bigger repo\ngit rm -rf btoa\n\n\nClearing your history\nBy default, removing files from Git doesn't actually remove them; it just commits that they aren't there any more. If you want to actually remove the historical references (i.e. you committed a password), you need to do this:\ngit filter-branch --prune-empty --tree-filter 'rm -rf <name-of-folder>' HEAD\n\nAfter that, you can check that your file or folder no longer shows up in the Git history at all:\ngit log -- <name-of-folder> # should show nothing\n\nHowever, you can't \"push\" deletes to GitHub and the like. If you try, you'll get an error and you'll have to git pull before you can git push - and then you're back to having everything in your history.\nSo if you want to delete history from the \"origin\" - meaning to delete it from GitHub, Bitbucket, etc - you'll need to delete the repo and re-push a pruned copy of the repo. But wait - there's more! - if you're really concerned about getting rid of a password or something like that you'll need to prune the backup (see below).\nMaking .git smaller\nThe aforementioned delete history command still leaves behind a bunch of backup files - because Git is all too kind in helping you to not ruin your repo by accident. It will eventually delete orphaned files over the days and months, but it leaves them there for a while in case you realize that you accidentally deleted something you didn't want to.\nSo if you really want to empty the trash to reduce the clone size of a repo immediately you have to do all of this really weird stuff:\nrm -rf .git/refs/original/ && \\\ngit reflog expire --all && \\\ngit gc --aggressive --prune=now\n\ngit reflog expire --all --expire-unreachable=0\ngit repack -A -d\ngit prune\n\nThat said, I'd recommend not performing these steps unless you know that you need to - just in case you did prune the wrong subdirectory, y'know? The backup files shouldn't get cloned when you push the repo, they'll just be in your local copy.\nCredit\n\nhttp://psionides.eu/2010/02/04/sharing-code-between-projects-with-git-subtree/\nRemove a directory permanently from git\nhttp://blogs.atlassian.com/2013/05/alternatives-to-git-submodule-git-subtree/\nHow to remove unreferenced blobs from my Git repository"}]}

These new commits have \"master commit #2\" (C in my diagram) as their ancestor, not their original ancestor where origin/master and origin/next diverged (A in my diagram), so their hashes will be different. I believe this is why you'll see that next has 8 different commits from origin/next: the 2 from origin/master and the 6 \"rehashed\" commits that were on origin/next.\nAfter git checkout next ; git rebase -i origin/master, you should have this:\n\nA-B-C  (master, origin/master)\n \\   \\\n  \\   D'-E'-F'-G'-H'-I' (next)\n   \\\n    D-E-F-G-H-I  (origin/next)\n\nYou can see that next does have 8 commits that aren't on origin/next, and origin/next does have 6 commits that aren't on next.

The actual content should match very closely if you git diff origin/next next -- the diff should just show the changes from B and C (as labeled in the diagram).\nWhen you do git pull --rebase while still on next, it fetches changes from the source (the remote origin/next) and rebases the current branch (next) onto that remote. This causes the changes that were in the next but not in origin/next to appear after origin/next on the new next branch.

In such a case, git merge-base origin/master topic would return the\nparent of B0 in the above picture, but B0^..D is not the range of\ncommits you would want to replay on top of B (it includes B0, which\nis not what you wrote; it is a commit the other side discarded when\nit moved its tip from B0 to B1). git merge-base --fork-point origin/master topic is designed to\nhelp in such a case.  It takes not only B but also B0, B1, and B2\n(i.e. old tips of the remote-tracking branches your repository’s\nreflog knows about) into account to see on which commit your topic\nbranch was built and finds B0, allowing you to replay only the\ncommits on your topic, excluding the commits the other side later\ndiscarded. Hence $ fork_point=$(git merge-base --fork-point origin/master topic) will find B0, and $ git rebase --onto origin/master $fork_point topic will replay D0, D1, and D on top of B to create a new history of this\nshape: o---B2\n\t\t/\n---o---o---B1--o---o---o---B (origin/master)\n\t\\                   \\\n\t B0                  D0'--D1'--D' (topic - updated)\n\t  \\\n\t   D0---D1---D (topic - old) A caveat is that older reflog entries in your repository may be\nexpired by git gc .

Also, the remote-tracking branch you use the --fork-point mode\nwith must be the one your topic forked from its tip.

GitHub shows these as \"submodule\" objects. Or do git submodule status from a command line. Git submodule objects are special kinds of Git objects, and they hold the SHA information for a specific commit.\nWhenever you do a git submodule update, it will populate your submodule with content from the commit. It knows where to find the commit because of the information in the .gitmodules.\nNow, all the -b does is add one line in your .gitmodules file. So following the same example, it would look like this:\n[submodule \"SubmoduleTestRepo\"]\n    path = SubmoduleTestRepo\n    url = https://github.com/jzaccone/SubmoduleTestRepo.git\n    branch = master\n\n\nNote: only branch name is supported in a .gitmodules file, but SHA and TAG are not supported! (instead of that, the branch's commit of each module can be tracked and updated using \"git add .\", for example like git add ./SubmoduleTestRepo, and you do not need to change the .gitmodules file each time)\n\nThe submodule object is still pointing at a specific commit. The only thing that the -b option buys you is the ability to add a --remote flag to your update as per Vogella's answer:\ngit submodule update --remote\n\nInstead of populating the content of the submodule to the commit pointed to by the submodule, it replaces that commit with the latest commit on the master branch, THEN it populates the submodule with that commit. This can be done in two steps by djacobs7 answer. Since you have now updated the commit the submodule object is pointing to, you have to commit the changed submodule object into your Git repository.\ngit submodule add -b is not some magically way to keep everything up to date with a branch. It is simply adds information about a branch in the .gitmodules file and gives you the option to update the submodule object to the latest commit of a specified branch before populating it."}]}

If you use either the subtree merge method (at least a variant of it that tracks history) or subrepository method in this answer, your subprojects will appear in your master project in Gitlab, but the master project will also track changes in the subprojects. \nAlternative Solution: Create a dummy repo that contains all of your desired repos as subrepos. This master repo will then track all subrepo changes. However; there are a few logistical issues, the .git files for the subrepos will not exist on Gitlab, so you might want a dedicated client with these files to pull the master repo from Gitlab (probably one commit at a time, if you want the subrepo histories to match the main repo history) and update the corresponding local subrepos (these could also be stored independently on GitLab)."}]}

Lets say in test branch I have the following .gitattributes file:\nconfig.xml merge=ours\n\nNow I checkout and point HEAD to master then merge in test.

To make things worse, the whole ours/theirs stuff switches roles (becomes backwards) when you are doing a rebase.\nUltimately, during a git merge, the \"ours\" branch refers to the branch you're merging into:\ngit checkout merge-into-ours\n\nand the \"theirs\" branch refers to the (single) branch you're merging:\ngit merge from-theirs\n\nand here \"ours\" and \"theirs\" makes some sense, as even though \"theirs\" is probably yours anyway, \"theirs\" is not the one you were on when you ran git merge.\nWhile using the actual branch name might be pretty cool, it falls apart in more complex cases.  For instance, instead of the above, you might do:\ngit checkout ours\ngit merge 1234567\n\nwhere you're merging by raw commit-ID.  Worse, you can even do this:\ngit checkout 7777777    # detach HEAD\ngit merge 1234567       # do a test merge\n\nin which case there are no branch names involved!\nI think it's little help here, but in fact, in gitrevisions syntax, you can refer to an individual path in the index by number, during a conflicted merge\ngit show :1:README\ngit show :2:README\ngit show :3:README\n\nStage #1 is the common ancestor of the files, stage #2 is the target-branch version, and stage #3 is the version you are merging from.\n\nThe reason the \"ours\" and \"theirs\" notions get swapped around during rebase is that rebase works by doing a series of cherry-picks, into an anonymous branch (detached HEAD mode).  The target branch is the anonymous branch, and the merge-from branch is your original (pre-rebase) branch: so \"--ours\" means the anonymous one rebase is building while \"--theirs\" means \"our branch being rebased\".\n\nAs for the gitattributes entry: it could have an effect: \"ours\" really means \"use stage #2\" internally.  But as you note, it's not actually in place at the time, so it should not have an effect here ... well, not unless you copy it into the work tree before you start.\nAlso, by the way, this applies to all uses of ours and theirs, but some are on a whole file level (-s ours for a merge strategy; git checkout --ours during a merge conflict) and some are on a piece-by-piece basis (-X ours or -X theirs during a -s recursive merge).  Which probably does not help with any of the confusion.\nI've never come up with a better name for these, though.

We also set up a GitHub Pages branch which is hosted under our GitHub Organization's subdomain, and used the Automatic Page Generator simply loading in our README.md file when we created our page. However, I notice that when I update our README.md file, it does not update the project page. Instead, we must go to the GitHub settings tab and recreate the project page, reloading the README.md file when we do it. \nAlso, after reading about relative linking working between documentation files on the GitHub project directory pages. I very much like the markdown as it saves tons of time from having to write all the HTML out by hand for our documentation. What I would like however is to be able to have one README.md file which is able to include relative links to other documentation files located at docs/*.md. I was hoping there was an easy solution so that my other documentation files might also be included in my gh-pages branch and be hosted under my GitHub Pages subdomain and be rendered and/or themed.\nIn other words, my questions are:\n\nIs there a way to have my README.md file automatically update on my Github Page subdomain?\n\n\n[ EDIT ] : No appears to be the answer if using the Automatic Page Generator. You must go to the settings page for the repo and reload it every time there is a change in order to update it.\n \n\nIs there a way I can have my relative links to my documentation on my README.md file work on my Github Pages, perhaps my somehow syncing my /docs/*.md to my Github Pages and somehow rendering and/or theming them?\n\n\n[ EDIT ] : From what I've learned since writing this question it appears that this is only possible on GitHub pages through the use of a static site generator like the ruby gem Jekyll and probably some uses of the webhooks supported by GitHub that are mentioned in the comments below. I am trying currently trying to find an optimal solution.\n \n\nBetter yet, is there an even easier way I can do this and perhaps have just one copy of my README.md and documentation that is used on both gh-pages and my main branch and makes everything easiest?\n\n\n[ EDIT ] : It seems this one is almost definitely a no. I was thinking about the possibility of something built into GitHub to allow this. It seems that better support for this kind of thing may could be built into GitHub Pages in the future, or at least I definitely hope it will be."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am going to post a solution that I setup that takes advantage of the fact that GitHub Pages uses Jekyll already using the Automatic Page Generator.\n\ngit checkout gh-pages\nmkdir _layouts\nmv index.html _layouts\ngit checkout master -- README.md\nmv README.md index.md\nPrepend the following text to index.md \n\n \n---\nlayout: index\n---\n\nYou also need to open the index.html file and make the following changes:\n\nRemove the rendered HTML from the markdown in your README.md file. This is usually between <section> or <article> tags. Replace this HTML with the text {{ content }} this will allow us to use this file as a jekyll. The file we apply the layout to will be placed where the content tag is.\nLocate the CSS for your project page theme. for me this was a line like the following:\n\n<link rel='stylesheet' href='stylesheets/stylesheet.css' />\n\nThis needs to be changed to\n\n<link rel='stylesheet' href='{{ site.path }}/stylesheets/stylesheet.css' />\n\nAny other assets stored on your site that will be used in this layout will also need to be prefixed with {{ site.path }}.\n\nBy doing this, Jekyll will render the markdown file as the content of the index.html layout in the _layouts directory. In order to automate this process for not just the README.md file, but also other docs you may have in your master branch, I have taken the following steps:\nCreated the file called post-commit containing the following:\n \n#!/bin/bash\n###\n### The following block runs after commit to \"master\" branch\n###\nif [ `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` == \"master\" ]; then\n\n    # Layout prefix is prepended to each markdown file synced\n    ###################################################################\n    LAYOUT_PREFIX='---\\r\\nlayout: index\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n\n    # Switch to gh-pages branch to sync it with master\n    ###################################################################\n    git checkout gh-pages\n\n    # Sync the README.md in master to index.md adding jekyll header\n    ###################################################################\n    git checkout master -- README.md\n    echo -e $LAYOUT_PREFIX > index.md\n    cat README.md >> index.md\n    rm README.md\n    git add index.md\n    git commit -a -m \"Sync README.md in master branch to index.md in gh-pages\"\n\n    # Sync the markdown files in the docs/* directory\n    ###################################################################\n    git checkout master -- docs\n    FILES=docs/*\n    for file in $FILES\n    do\n        echo -e $LAYOUT_PREFIX | cat - \"$file\" > temp && mv temp \"$file\"\n    done\n\n    git add docs\n    git commit -a -m \"Sync docs from master branch to docs gh-pages directory\"\n\n    # Uncomment the following push if you want to auto push to\n    # the gh-pages branch whenever you commit to master locally.\n    # This is a little extreme. Use with care!\n    ###################################################################\n    # git push origin gh-pages\n\n    # Finally, switch back to the master branch and exit block\n    git checkout master\nfi\n\nEDIT: I updated the above script for both the README.md file and the markdown in docs/* to both use the same layout file. This is a much better setup than what I had before. This script goes in your .git/hooks/ directory. bash must be in your path.\nCreate the file _config.yml with the following\nmarkdown: redcarpet\npath: http://username.github.io/reponame\n\nThe above script also syncs markdown files found in the docs/* directory of the master branch, in order that they may be viewed on the GitHub Pages site as well. Relative linking to these documents works if you include the following jQuery function in order to strip the .md extension from the anchors on the gh-pages branch. You can add the following script to index.html in the _layouts directory:\n$(document).on('ready', function () {\n    $('a').each(function (i, e) {\n        var href = e.href;\n        if (href.search('.md') > 0)\n            $(this).attr('href', href.split('.md')[0]);\n    });\n});\n\nEDIT: I changed the code above in my repository, this was a quick and dirty way to do this, but it won't work right in all cases if you know what I mean.. For example, the markdown file company.mdata.md would not be processed correctly. To fix this I updated this to the following script which more carefully checks out the href and removes the extension if found. I also made the script more generic, allowing it to be used to remove other extensions by changing the ext variable. Here is the code:\n$(function () {\n    $('a').each(function () {\n        var ext = '.md';\n        var href = $(this).attr('href');\n        var position = href.length - ext.length;\n        if (href.substring(position) === ext)\n            $(this).attr('href', href.substring(0, position));\n    });\n});\n\nI setup an example repo at CoryG89/docsync, which has a project page here, if you'd like to see how all this works together."}]}

Attempting to push to a remote that contains the old history will fail because it is not a fast-forward.\nIf the branch you rebased is a topic or feature branch in which you are working by yourself, no big deal. Pushing to another repository will require the --force option, or alternatively you may be able, depending on the remote repository’s permissions, to first delete the old branch and then push the rebased version. Examples of those commands that will potentially destroy work is outside the scope of this answer.\nRewriting already-published history on a branch in which you are working with other people without very good reason such as leaking a password or other sensitive details forces work onto your collaborators and is antisocial and will annoy other developers. The “Recovering From an Upstream Rebase” section in the git rebase documentation explains, with added emphasis.\n\nRebasing (or any other form of rewriting) a branch that others have based work on is a bad idea: anyone downstream of it is forced to manually fix their history. This section explains how to do the fix from the downstream’s point of view. The real fix, however, would be to avoid rebasing the upstream in the first place. …"}]}

See this page for notes and settings you should set.\nNamely:\ngit config [--global] core.quotepath off\ngit config [--global] i18n.logoutputencoding utf8\ngit config [--global] i18n.commitencoding utf8\ngit config [--global] --unset svn.pathnameencoding\n\nThe recodetree check command scans the entire history of a git repository and prints all non-ASCII file names. If the output is empty, no migration is necessary.\n\nUpdate February 2012: patches for UTF-8 supports are comming in branch 'devel' of msysgit repo on GitHub, including Update less settings for UTF-8 .\nThe Git for Windows Google+ page mentions:\n\nKarsten Blees' UTF-8 patches for Git for Windows has now been merged to 'devel'.\nThis means the upcoming release will support Unicode filenames!\n\n\nMay 2011\nI believe the msysgit issue 80 has the latest on that bug.\nAlso described in issue 376.\nFor example:\n\nThis is what happens:\n\ngit on Windows operates on file names and treats them essentially as byte streams.\nIn your case, the streams happen to be UTF8 encoded text.\n\ngit on Windows asks the runtime to create a file, and passes it the byte stream.\n\nSince internally on Windows everything is Unicode, the runtime converts the byte\nstream to UTF16 using the currently set locale (aka \"codepage\").\nThat is, it effectively interprets the byte stream as CP949 (Korean) encoded text.\nApparently, some of the UTF8 byte sequences are invalid CP949 sequences, and the conversion fails (\"Invalid argument\"); or if the UTF8 sequences happen to be correct CP949 sequences, the result is (most likely) a different character.\n\n\n\nThe true fix should be on MingW though:\n\nIt occurs to me that one solution would be this: solve it at the GCC C run-time\nlibrary level.\nThat is, for the mingw GCC run-time library on Windows, make it possible via build-time options to be in a mode where the command-line parameters (passed to main()) and file I/O functions use the underlying Windows Unicode API calls, and translate to/from UTF-8 encoding in C's standard function APIs that use byte-strings.\nThat would \"just work\" for git perhaps, and could be useful for other Linux-originated open source projects running the Windows environment.\n\nak2 comments that MingW isn't the right place for this fix:\n\n\"MinGW compilers provide access to the functionality of the Microsoft C runtime and some language-specific runtimes.\nMinGW, being Minimalist, does not, and never will, attempt to provide a POSIX runtime environment for POSIX application deployment on MS-Windows.\nIf you want POSIX application deployment on this platform, please consider Cygwin instead.\"\n\nThere is some work in progress on a msysgit variant to support unicode."}]}

I've heard that there is a light at the end of the tunnel though. Apparently I can use either git-tf or git-tfs and treat my code as if it was managed by git, but be able to push/pull to/from a central TFS server.\nMy main question is I'm not sure which one of these I should use. There is git-tf which is officially supported by Microsoft, and there is git-tfs which has been around a lot longer. What's the differences between these and which should I try out first?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Disclaimer: I started the git-tf project and although the project is now in very capable hands without me as a frequent contributor, you should absolutely consider my opinions on this to be strongly biased.  (And, assuming you're on Windows, perhaps unexpected.)\nThere are two fundamental differences between the two tools:\n\ngit-tfs was built for Windows users and written on top of the .NET TFS SDK.  The TFS SDK will not run under Mono, so this makes git-tfs unsuitable for cross-platform use.\ngit-tf was built for cross-platform users and written on top of the Java TFS SDK.  Thus, it will run anywhere that's supported by the Java TFS SDK (Windows, Mac, Linux, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, etc...)  git-tf was explicitly created to allow Xcode users to access TFS.\n\nOn Windows, of course, you can use either.  I'm not going to necessarily say one is better than the other.  But I will say:\n\nMy biggest complaint about git-tfs is that it won't work on Mac OS.  If there was a way to make git-tfs cross-platform, then git-tf almost certainly wouldn't exist.\ngit-tfs is faster in some cases than git-tf.  Performance was not our priority in the first few revisions, correctness was.\nBecause git-tf has a wide platform support matrix, this means that its functionality is necessarily constrained.  For example, there is no UI.  git-tfs, on the other hand, has a checkintool command that will open the normal TFS Checkin dialog.  This can be exceptionally helpful in visualizing your changes.  (If I recall, you can open up a proper visual diff from there, etc.)\ngit-tf works by populating the git repository directly, downloading TFS objects directly into the git object database.  git-tfs works by creating a TFS working folder mapping in a hidden folder, then populating the git repository from that.  There's a disk penalty here, so if you have superginormous repositories, you might feel this.\ngit-tfs can try to map your TFS branches to your git branches.  A lot of people will see this as a positive for git-tfs, though I don't:  git's branching model (at the repository level) and TFS's branching model (represented as folders in the repository) are so radically different as to cause problems in anything but the most simplistic workflows.  But your mileage may vary.\ngit-tfs is actively developed by a community.  git-tf has not had the community adoption.\n\nI don't want to make it sound like I'm saying git-tf is bad.  It's not.  I think it's actually pretty good.  But it may not be your best choice.\n\nUpdate: git-tf has reached end-of-life.  It is no longer maintained or supported by Microsoft.  We recommend git-tfs if you want a bidirectional TFS <-> git solution."}]}

Now suppose there's a new feature which requires improvements in the submodule. The developer charged with this converts his workspace to this:\ndeveloper:project.git\n   \\- developer:submodule.git\n\nGetting there is not trivial as he needs to replace a submdule with another submodule (to git, the original and the fork of the submodule are two different things).\nIf this developer works on the library for a bit longer, he commits this structure to his master branch, so his fork on github always uses the forked submodule.\nOnce he's ready with development, he'll create a pull request. The problem is that when merging the pull request the main repository will look like this:\ncompany:project.git\n   \\- developer:submodule.git\n\nThis is problematic as now every developer that tracks the company branch will end up with the developer's submodule.\nTo workaround the problem, before the developer makes a pull request, his master branch should be moved back to the company:submodule.git - which is just very awkward, especially since locally he'll always still want to work with developer:submodule.git.\nWe've tried several workflows, and the above issue is the only one where we don't have a good workflow yet."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When the developer creates a commit with the submodule at a particular version, that's a strong statement that the supermodule works with the submodule at that exact version.

If there are two different remote repositories, he can just add an extra remote in the submodule.  (The developer should change .gitmodules as well if they're going to share their repository with anyone else.)\n\nIn response to your comment below, perhaps it's worth going through how to switch a submodule from pointing to one version to another.  Let's suppose that the developer is using their own repositories for the super and submodule, but those are both cloned from the company's versions (i.e. so most of the history is the same), and the submodule is at the path lib.  The developer now wants to switch the submodule to point to the company's version instead.  They can do the following:\n\nEdit the url parameter for the submodule in .gitmodules to point to the company's repository.\ncd lib\ngit remote add company developer@company:/srv/git/lib.git\ngit fetch company\ngit checkout -b upstream-master company/master\ncd ..\ngit add .gitmodules lib\ngit commit -m \"Switch the lib submodule to point back to the company's version\"\n\nSteps 3 to 5 can just be changed to git checkout <whatever> once the remote and branch are set up."}]}

Start out by reading the post in Ube's link. But to attempt an answer:\nHard reset\ngit reset --hard [HEAD]\n\ncompletely remove all staged and unstaged changes to tracked files.\nI find myself often using hard resetting, when I'm like \"just undo everything like if I had done a complete re-clone from the remote\". In your case, where you just want your repo pristine, this would work.\nClean\ngit clean [-f]\n\nRemove files that are not tracked.\nFor removing temporary files, but keep staged and unstaged changes to already tracked files. Most times, I would probably end up making an ignore-rule instead of repeatedly cleaning - e.g. for the bin/obj folders in a C# project, which you would usually want to exclude from your repo to save space, or something like that.\nThe -f (force) option will also remove files, that are not tracked and are also being ignored by git though ignore-rule. In the case above, with an ignore-rule to never track the bin/obj folders, even though these folders are being ignored by git, using the force-option will remove them from your file system. I've sporadically seen a use for this, e.g. when scripting deployment, and you want to clean your code before deploying, zipping or whatever.\nGit clean will not touch files, that are already being tracked.\nCheckout \"dot\"\ngit checkout .\n\nI had actually never seen this notation before reading your post. I'm having a hard time finding documentation for this (maybe someone can help), but from playing around a bit, it looks like it means:\n\"undo all changes in my working tree\".\nI.e. undo unstaged changes in tracked files. It apparently doesn't touch staged changes and leaves untracked files alone.\nStashing\nSome answers mention stashing. As the wording implies, you would probably use stashing when you are in the middle of something (not ready for a commit), and you have to temporarily switch branches or somehow work on another state of your code, later to return to your \"messy desk\". I don't see this applies to your question, but it's definitely handy.\nTo sum up\nGenerally, if you are confident you have committed and maybe pushed to a remote important changes, if you are just playing around or the like, using git reset --hard HEAD followed by git clean -f will definitively cleanse your code to the state, it would be in, had it just been cloned and checked out from a branch. It's really important to emphasize, that the resetting will also remove staged, but uncommitted changes. It will wipe everything that has not been committed (except untracked files, in which case, use clean).\nAll the other commands are there to facilitate more complex scenarios, where a granularity of \"undoing stuff\" is needed :)\nI feel, your question #1 is covered, but lastly, to conclude on #2: the reason you never found the need to use git reset --hard was that you had never staged anything. Had you staged a change, neither git checkout . nor git clean -f would have reverted that.\nHope this covers."}]}

You can configure git rebase to use --autostash by default as well, with git config --global rebase.autoStash true.  Please note the following sentence from the documentation:\n\nHowever, use with care: the final stash\n   application after a successful rebase might result in non-trivial\n   conflicts.\n\n(I still prefer to just make commits.)\nTL;DR answer: just make a commit (then unmake it later)\nIt may help you to realize that git stash is really just git commit (in a more complicated form, which commits the index first, then the work-tree—when you apply a stash, you can maintain the separation of index and work-tree, or combine them into just a work-tree change).\nWhat makes a stash special is that the commits it makes—the two or, with -u or -a, even three commits—are made in an unusual form (as a merge commit that's not really a merge) and not placed on any branch (instead, the special refs/stash reference is used to retain and find them).\nSince they're not on a branch, rebase does not touch them, and in your workflow, it's the git stash pop that brings the work-tree changes into your new work-tree.  However, if you make your own (normal) commit, on a branch, and rebase and include that commit, this normal commit will be rebased along with any others.  We'll get to one last problem in a moment; for now, let's draw this up, as a series of commits that do (or don't) get rebased:\n... do some work ...\n... make some commits ...\n... more work ...\n... do something that causes upstream/master to update, such as git fetch upstream\n$ git stash\n\nAt this point, here's what you have:\n... - o - * - A - B - C     <-- HEAD=master\n           \\          |\\\n            \\         i-w   <-- stash\n             \\\n              @-@-@         <-- upstream/master\n\nHere, A, B, and C are your commits (I'll assume you've made 3), all on branch master.  The i-w hanging off commit C is your stash, which is not on the branch, but is still a two-commit \"git stash bag\" and is actually attached to your latest commit (C).  The @ commits (there might be just one) are the new upstream commits.\n(If you have made no commits, your stash-bag hangs off commit *, and your current branch points to commit *, so that git rebase has no work to do other than move your current branch pointer forward.  Everything works out the same, in this case, but I'll assume there are some commits.)\nNow you run git rebase upstream/master.  This copies your commits to new commits, with new IDs and new parent IDs, so that they sit atop the last @.  The stash-bag does not move, so the result looks like this:\n... - o - * - A - B - C     [abandoned, except for the stash]\n           \\          |\\\n            \\         i-w   <-- stash\n             \\\n              @-@-@         <-- upstream/master\n                   \\\n                    A'-B'-C'   <-- HEAD=master\n\nYou now use git stash pop, which restores the i/w stuff as work-tree changes, erasing the stash label (more precisely, popping it so that stash@{1}, if it exists, is now stash, and so on).  That releases the last references to the original A - B - C chain, and means we don't need the i-w bit either, which lets us redraw this as the much simpler:\n... - @            <-- upstream/master\n       \\\n        A'-B'-C'   <-- HEAD=master plus work tree changes\n\nNow let's draw what happens if, instead of git stash save, you just do a git commit -a (or git add and git commit without -a) to create an actual commit D.  You start with:\n... - o-*-A-B-C-D   <-- HEAD=master\n         \\\n          @-@-@     <-- upstream/master\n\nNow you git rebase upstream/master, which copies A through D to place them at the end of the last @, and you have this:\n... - o-*-@-@-@     <-- upstream/master\n               \\\n                A'-B'-C'-D'   <-- HEAD=master\n\nThe only problem is that you have this one unwanted extra commit D (well, D' now), instead of uncommitted work-tree changes.  But this is trivially undone with git reset to step back one commit.  We can use a --mixed reset—the default—to get the index (staging area) re-set too, so as to \"un-add\" all the files, or if you want them to stay git add-ed, a --soft reset.  (Neither affects the resulting commit graph, only the index state is different.)\ngit reset --mixed HEAD^   # or leave out `--mixed` since it's the default\n\nHere's what that looks like:\n... - o-*-@-@-@     <-- upstream/master\n               \\\n                A'-B'-C'      <-- HEAD=master\n                        \\\n                         D'   [abandoned]\n\nYou might think this is inefficient, but when you use git stash you're actually making at least two commits, which you then abandon later when you git stash pop them.  The real difference is that by making temporary, not-for-publication commits, you get those automatically rebased.\nDon't be afraid of temporary commits\nThere's a general rule with git: make lots of temporary commits, to save your work as you go.  You can always rebase them away later.  That is, instead of this:\n... - * - A - B - C   <-- mybranch\n\nwhere A, B, and C are perfect and final commits atop commit * (from someone else or earlier published stuff), make this:\n... - * - a1 - a2 - b1 - a3 - b2 - a4 - b3 - c1 - b4 - c2 - c3\n\nwhere a1 is an initial stab at A, a2 fixes a bug in a1, b1 is an initial attempt to make b work, a3 is from realizing that b1 requires A to be different after all, b2 fixes a bug in b1, a4 fixes a bug in a3's change to a2, and b3 is what b1 should have done; then c1 is an initial attempt at C, b4 is another fix to b1, c2 is a refinement, and so on.\nLet's say that after c3 you think it's mostly ready.  Now you run git rebase -i origin/master or whatever, shuffle the pick lines to get a1 through a4 into order, b1 through b4 into order, and c1 through c3 into order, and let the rebase run.  Then you fix any conflicts and make sure stuff is still right, then you run another git rebase -i to collapse all four a versions into A, and so on.\nWhen you're all done, it looks like you created a perfect A the first time (or maybe with a4 or some other one depending on which commits you keep and which ones you drop and whether you re-set any time stamps in things).  Other people may not want or need to see your intermediate work—though you can retain it, not combining commits, if that's useful.  Meanwhile you never need to have uncommitted stuff that you have to rebase, because you just have commits of partial stuff.\nIt does help to give these commits names, in the one-line commit text, that will guide your later rebase work:\ngit commit -m 'temp commit: work to enable frabulator, incomplete'\n\nand so on."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are Git's pack files deltas rather than snapshots?\nOne of the key differences between Git and most other version control systems is that the others tend to store commits as a series of deltas - changesets between one commit and the next. This seems logical, since it's the smallest possible amount of information to store about a commit. But the longer the commit history gets, the more calculation it takes to compare ranges of revisions.\nBy contrast, Git stores a complete snapshot of the whole project in each revision. The reason this doesn't make the repo size grow dramatically with each commit is each file in the project is stored as a file in the Git subdirectory, named for the hash of its contents. So if the contents haven't changed, the hash hasn't changed, and the commit just points to the same file. And there are other optimizations as well.\nAll this made sense to me until I stumbled on this information about pack files, into which Git puts data periodically to save space:\n\nIn order to save that space, Git\n  utilizes the packfile. This is a\n  format where Git will only save the\n  part that has changed in the second\n  file, with a pointer to the file it is\n  similar to.\n\nIsn't this basically going back to storing deltas? If not, how is it different? How does this avoid subjecting Git to the same problems other version controls systems have?\nFor example, Subversion uses deltas, and rolling back 50 versions means undoing 50 diffs, whereas with Git you can just grab the appropriate snapshot. Unless git also stores 50 diffs in the packfiles... is there some mechanism that says \"after some small number of deltas, we'll store a whole new snapshot\" so that we don't pile up too large a changeset? How else might Git avoid the disadvantages of deltas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Summary:\nGit’s pack files are carefully constructed to effectively use disk caches and\nprovide “nice” access patterns for common commands and for reading recently referenced\nobjects.\n\nGit’s pack file\nformat is quite flexible (see Documentation/technical/pack-format.txt,\nor The Packfile in The Git Community Book).\nThe pack files store objects in two main\nways: “undeltified” (take the raw object data and deflate-compress\nit), or “deltified” (form a delta against some other object then\ndeflate-compress the resulting delta data). The objects stored in\na pack can be in any order (they do not (necessarily) have to be\nsorted by object type, object name, or any other attribute) and\ndeltified objects can be made against any other suitable object of the same type.\nGit’s pack-objects command uses several heuristics to\nprovide excellent locality of reference for common\ncommands. These heuristics control both the selection of base\nobjects for deltified objects and the order of the objects. Each\nmechanism is mostly independent, but they share some goals.\nGit does form long chains of delta compressed objects, but the\nheuristics try to make sure that only “old” objects are at the ends of \nthe long chains. The delta base cache (whose size is controlled by the\ncore.deltaBaseCacheLimit configuration variable) is automatically\nused and can greatly reduce the number of “rebuilds” required for\ncommands that need to read a large number of objects (e.g. git log\n-p).\nDelta Compression Heuristic\nA typical Git repository stores a very large number of objects, so\nit can not reasonably compare them all to find the pairs (and\nchains) that will yield the smallest delta representations.\nThe delta base selection heuristic is based on the idea that the\ngood delta bases will be found among objects with similar filenames\nand sizes. Each type of object is processed separately (i.e. an\nobject of one type will never be used as the delta base for an\nobject of another type).\nFor the purposes of delta base selection, the objects are sorted (primarily) by\nfilename and then size. A window into this sorted list is used to limit\nthe number of objects that are considered as potential delta bases.\nIf a “good enough”1 delta representation is not found for an object\namong the objects in its window, then the object will not be delta\ncompressed.\nThe size of the window is controlled by the --window= option of\ngit pack-objects, or the pack.window configuration variable. The\nmaximum depth of a delta chain is controlled by the --depth=\noption of git pack-objects, or the pack.depth configuration\nvariable. The --aggressive option of git gc greatly enlarges\nboth the window size and the maximum depth to attempt to create\na smaller pack file.\nThe filename sort clumps together the objects for entries with with\nidentical names (or at least similar endings (e.g. .c)). The size\nsort is from largest to smallest so that deltas that remove data are\npreferred to deltas that add data (since removal deltas have shorter\nrepresentations) and so that the earlier, larger objects (usually\nnewer) tend to be represented with plain compression.\n1\nWhat qualifies as “good enough” depends on the size of the object in question and its potential delta base as well as how deep its resulting delta chain would be.\nObject Ordering Heuristic\nObjects are stored in the pack files in a “most recently referenced”\norder. The objects needed to reconstruct the most recent history are\nplaced earlier in the pack and they will be close together. This\nusually works well for OS disk caches.\nAll the commit objects are sorted by commit date (most recent first)\nand stored together. This placement and ordering optimizes the disk\naccesses needed to walk the history graph and extract basic commit\ninformation (e.g. git log).\nThe tree and blob objects are stored starting with the tree from the\nfirst stored (most recent) commit. Each tree is processed in a depth\nfirst fashion, storing any objects that have not already been\nstored. This puts all the trees and blobs required to reconstruct\nthe most recent commit together in one place. Any trees and blobs that\nhave not yet been saved but that are required for later commits are\nstored next, in the sorted commit order.\nThe final object ordering is slightly affected by the delta base selection\nin that if an object is selected for delta representation and its base object\nhas not been stored yet, then its base object is stored immediately before the\ndeltified object itself. This prevents likely disk cache misses due to the\nnon-linear access required to read a base object that would have “naturally” been\nstored later in the pack file."}]}

Using --index-filter with git rm yields a significantly faster\nversion.  Like with using rm filename , git rm --cached filename will fail if the file is absent from the tree of a commit.  If you\nwant to \"completely forget\" a file, it does not matter when it entered\nhistory, so we also add --ignore-unmatch : git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch filename' HEAD Now, you will get the rewritten history saved in HEAD. To rewrite the repository to look as if foodir/ had been its project\nroot, and discard all other history: git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter foodir -- --all Thus you can, e.g., turn a library subdirectory into a repository of\nits own.  Note the -- that separates filter-branch options from\nrevision options, and the --all to rewrite all branches and tags. To set a commit (which typically is at the tip of another\nhistory) to be the parent of the current initial commit, in\norder to paste the other history behind the current history: git filter-branch --parent-filter 'sed \"s/^\\$/-p <graft-id>/\"' HEAD (if the parent string is empty - which happens when we are dealing with\nthe initial commit - add graftcommit as a parent).  Note that this assumes\nhistory with a single root (that is, no merge without common ancestors\nhappened).  If this is not the case, use: git filter-branch --parent-filter \\\n\t'test $GIT_COMMIT = <commit-id> && echo \"-p <graft-id>\" || cat' HEAD or even simpler: git replace --graft $commit-id $graft-id\ngit filter-branch $graft-id..HEAD To remove commits authored by \"Darl McBribe\" from the history: git filter-branch --commit-filter '\n\tif [ \"$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME\" = \"Darl McBribe\" ];\n\tthen\n\t\tskip_commit \"$@\";\n\telse\n\t\tgit commit-tree \"$@\";\n\tfi' HEAD The function skip_commit is defined as follows: skip_commit()\n{\n\tshift;\n\twhile [ -n \"$1\" ];\n\tdo\n\t\tshift;\n\t\tmap \"$1\";\n\t\tshift;\n\tdone;\n} The shift magic first throws away the tree id and then the -p\nparameters.  Note that this handles merges properly! In case Darl\ncommitted a merge between P1 and P2, it will be propagated properly\nand all children of the merge will become merge commits with P1,P2\nas their parents instead of the merge commit. NOTE the changes introduced by the commits, and which are not reverted\nby subsequent commits, will still be in the rewritten branch. If you want\nto throw out changes together with the commits, you should use the\ninteractive mode of git rebase . You can rewrite the commit log messages using --msg-filter .  For\nexample, git svn-id strings in a repository created by git svn can\nbe removed this way: git filter-branch --msg-filter '\n\tsed -e \"/^git-svn-id:/d\"\n' If you need to add Acked-by lines to, say, the last 10 commits (none\nof which is a merge), use this command: git filter-branch --msg-filter '\n\tcat &&\n\techo \"Acked-by: Bugs Bunny <bunny@bugzilla.org>\"\n' HEAD~10..HEAD The --env-filter option can be used to modify committer and/or author\nidentity.  For example, if you found out that your commits have the wrong\nidentity due to a misconfigured user.email, you can make a correction,\nbefore publishing the project, like this: git filter-branch --env-filter '\n\tif test \"$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL\" = \"root@localhost\"\n\tthen\n\t\tGIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=john@example.com\n\tfi\n\tif test \"$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL\" = \"root@localhost\"\n\tthen\n\t\tGIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=john@example.com\n\tfi\n' -- --all To restrict rewriting to only part of the history, specify a revision\nrange in addition to the new branch name.  The new branch name will\npoint to the top-most revision that a git rev-list of this range\nwill print. Consider this history: D--E--F--G--H\n    /     /\nA--B-----C To rewrite only commits D,E,F,G,H, but leave A, B and C alone, use: git filter-branch ... C..H To rewrite commits E,F,G,H, use one of these: git filter-branch ... C..H --not D\ngit filter-branch ... D..H --not C To move the whole tree into a subdirectory, or remove it from there: git filter-branch --index-filter \\\n\t'git ls-files -s | sed \"s-\\t\\\"*-&newsubdir/-\" |\n\t\tGIT_INDEX_FILE=$GIT_INDEX_FILE.new \\\n\t\t\tgit update-index --index-info &&\n\t mv \"$GIT_INDEX_FILE.new\" \"$GIT_INDEX_FILE\"' HEAD"}]}

I would typically right-click on my project, select Team->Synchronize, double-click on the first changed file (in the Team Sync perspective), then hit Ctrl-. repeatedly to review all changes in one file, and then proceed to the next file, as I wrote a summary of my changes for the commit message.\nBut of course, git is very different from Subversion, and so my workflow must change. With EGit, \"Team Sync\" only appears to be useful for reviewing changes between my local files and the remote repository (i.e. before a push to the remote). I need a way to review changes since my last commit to my local repository. I generally don't even care to (re)review changes before a push to remote (and if I did, I'd prefer a simple equivalent of git log to see what commits I'm about to push).\nIf I right-click on my project and select Team->Commit, I am presented with a window that does almost everything I need to do (select files to stage, commit, write a commit message, amend a previous commit, etc.). What it doesn't allow me to do is quickly and easily review all my changes in a compare editor. I can't believe this capability doesn't exist! It seems I am required to double-click on each individual file, review the changes, close the compare editor, and double-click on the next file. That's ridiculous!\nTL/DR - I am looking for a simple GUI equivalent (in Eclipse) to do what I am easily able to do from the command line using git vimdiff (where vimdiff is a git alias that uses vimdiff as the \"difftool\" to cycle through all modified files) followed by git commit (with perhaps a git add or two in between).\nIf no one has a good solution, I am curious about how others handle their commit workflow with EGit. I've been getting along fine committing from the command line (not that Eclipse is happy about that) but I can't believe that EGit is as near-useless as it seems to me. Perhaps my google-fu is not as strong as it once was?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Says here that you can see the diffs between the working tree and any given reference.

Here's how:\nIn the moment of writing this, Eclipse Juno 4.2 is the version you should go for. On the download page, you can pick between several packages according to your needs. The 'Eclipse IDE for Java Developers' comes bundled with EGit, but you can also install EGit into any distribution using the Eclipse Marketplace (under the Help menu).\n\nOnce you've imported your project into Eclipse, make sure the project is \"shared\":\n\nRight-click project -> Team -> Share Project.. -> Git\nNow do the following:\n\nSwitch to the Team Synchronizing Perspective.\nClick the little synchronize button in the Synchronize View.\nChoose Git\nPick a suitable branch to sync against, like refs/remotes/origin/master\nMake sure to check the \"Include local uncommitted changes in comparison\" box\nClick Finish\n\nNow, change some files and watch them appear in the Synchronize View.

This happens because the file .gitignore gets created before the git status --porcelain is executed.

This is the moment to run every test you can think of.\nIf all is working out, merge the feature or fix into the stable branch. Now the change is live for your customers.\n\nGetting the code on the server\nThe updating of servers shouldn't be a problem. Basically I would set them up as users just like you're developers are. At my company we've setup the servers as read-only users. Basically that means the servers can never push anything but can always pull. Setting this up isn't trivial though, so you could just as well build a simple webinterface which simply only allows a git pull. If you can keep your developers from doing stuff on live implementations you're safe :)\n[EDIT]\nIn response to the last questions asked in the comments of this reaction:\nI don't know if I understand your question correctly, but basically (simplified a bit) this is how I would do this, were I in you shoes.\n\nThe testing machine (or the webroot which acts as testing implementation) has it source code based in a git repository with the master branch checked out. While creating this repository you could even remove all other references to all other branches so you'll be sure no can checkout a wrong branch in this repository. So basically the testing machine has a Git repository with only a master branch which is checked out.\nFor the live servers I would do exactly the same, but this time with the stable branch checked out. Developer should have a local repository cloned in which all branches exist. And a local implementation of the software you guys build. This software gets its source from a the local git repository. In other words: from the currently checked out branch in this repository.\nActual coding\nWhen a new feature is wanted, a local feature branch can be made based on the current master. When the branch is checked out the changes can be made and checked locally by the developer (since the software is now running on the source of the feature branch).\nIf everything seems to be in order, the changes get merged from feature branch to master and pushed to your \"git machine\". \"your github\" so to speak. Testing can now pull the changes in so every test necessary can be done by QA. If they decide everything is ok, the developer can merge the changes from master to stable and push again.\nAll thats left now is pulling form your live machines."}]}

If you don't care about history, you can always push files in your Gist. Let's say you have a repository containing multiple folders and you want for each folder to create a Gist.

Most likely it's trash or a temporary file that can be safely deleted. Judging from the name, it's probably the file name used as a temporary text editing area for merge commit messages.\nThen, since you use VIM, when VIM starts, it tries to create a swap file for its own internal needs. The error message says it's ~/Documents/Sites/recipegenerator/.git/.MERGE_MSG.swp. Often, you can simply delete such swap files, especially if they are old or unexpected. However, if recently some merge-commit-message-editing session has crashed and if you had a lot of creative text you don't want to lose - then don't delete it and recover that swap instead, as described in (2) in the error message.\nHowever, since you don't know what is going on and you haven't said anything about losing some text you wrote, and since it's probably just a MERGE_MSG that was auto-generated anyways, I suppose you can:\ngit merge --abort\nrm ~/Documents/Sites/recipegenerator/.git/.MERGE_MSG.swp\n\nand try what you were doing once again.\nAlso, it's good to check the hint mentioned in (1) in error message. Check with ps or whatever else for any open VIM sessions that could be currently editing that MERGE_MSG. If you spot any, then, well, get to them and either finish editing, or make them quit (escape, :q!, enter) (vim will cleanup swaps on quitting), or terminate them (kill them, but then you need to remove swap files manually)."}]}

The primary use case, then, is to have a publicly accessible repository (on GitHub) that is registerd with a name and git repository url. I just did this myself:\nbower register linksoup git://github.com/automatonic/linksoup\n\nThis is just telling the bower server that when you install linksoup to go and grab the code at the git://github.com/automatonic/linksoup repository, and put it in the local project's component directory.\nIf this is what you want to do, then just set up a repository on github/etc., push your code there, and then register with the resulting repository info.\nOption 2: Private dependency\nThere are many reasons not to post your code at a publicly accessible repository. It may not be open source, etc. if your mypackage code is not meant to be public, then you should probably not be registering it on the public bower server... Further, even if you could register a local directory, it would only work on your machine...which defeats the purpose of sharing the code via bower.\nIf you just want to have bower manage a local, private dependency, then I am going to riff off of blockhead's solution:\n{\n  \"name\": \"myproject\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"jquery\": \"1.8.0\",\n    \"twitter/bootstrap\": \"2.1.1\",\n    \"mypackage\": \"file:///path/to/mypackage/.git\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is just saying that myproject needs mypackage, and to use git clone to retrieve it. My guess is that this can use anything git can understand (including local repositories). But you should note that this may run into problems for anyone else working on this code that cannot access your local path.\nBest Guess\nIt looks to me as if you may have assumed that bower register was a local operation (telling bower how to find a dependency via some sort of local registry). As far as I can tell, this is only a remote and public registration, which is why this is unsupported.\nYou may also be looking for a way to do something like a link operation with npm. That is, work on a dependency module without always having your dev cycle include a publish.\nA little detail about how many people are involved and what you were trying to accomplish would facilitate a more targeted answer."}]}

Is there a way to get detached heads to appear in this graph?\nI know that git reflog exists, but that is pretty hard to read since there is no structure - all you have to go on is the commit message, which still may be WIP if I haven't finished the commit yet.\nSome background (this is not necessary to answer the question, but will help explain the motivation for it): I'm a Mercurial user and my workflow involves a lot of anonymous branching. I tend to make use of hg heads a lot to check out these heads, and often hg rebase to separate or combine series of commits based on what makes sense for the purpose of an easy to understand code review.\nWhile I'm getting used to using git I often find myself with detached heads when, for example, I rebase some commits from a branch to make a new branch. Finding these detached heads is annoying with git reflog, and to be honest it's a little scary that they just disappear from the usual git log. I've even forgotten about old commits this way, and have had to dig them out of git reflog a day or two later. In Mercurial those commits would remain as an anonymous head, and I would be reminded that I need to finish them off."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It sounds like you're trying to use a workflow that doesn't quite match the way git works.\nFirst of all, a \"detached head\" in git isn't the same as Mercurial's concept of a \"head\". Git has exactly one HEAD, which is just the currently checked-out commit. \"Detached\" just means that you don't currently have a branch checked out. So when you create a commit, it won't be associated with a branch, and it'll be lost when you checkout a different commit.\nIn Git, every commit that you care about should be reachable from some branch. There's no such thing as an \"anonymous branch\", which is why git warns you when committing on a detached head. Committing on a detached head is like allocating an object and then throwing away the pointer; it's possible, but almost never what you want to do. Remember, branches in git are lightweight and can be ephemeral. Just create a branch before committing so that you can find your commits again.\nAll that being said, if you really want to see the structure of your repository, including commits that are only referenced from reflogs, you can use:\ngit log --graph --decorate $(git rev-list -g --all)"}]}

In your .gitlab-ci.yml, you can specify the section only with tags.\nRefer to GitLab documentation for tags and only.\nAn example is when you push a tag with git:\n$ git tag -a 1.0.0 -m \"1.0.0\"\n$ git push origin 1.0.0\n\nAnd a job in .gitlab-ci.yml like this:\ncompile:\n    stage: build\n    only: [tags]\n    script:\n        - echo Working...\n    tags: [testing]    \n\nwould start using a runner with the testing tag.\nBy my understanding, what is missing in your steps is to specify the tag testing to your runner.

The consequences, if I am not mistaken, may be:\n 1. if developers pull B and they have commits on local master of B, they will lose their local changes;\n 2. developers may face big troubles during rebase their local branches after the forced update of branch B.\nHow should I proceed to avoid any problems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If I understand it correctly, you have a single (local) repository which looks somewhat like this:\n            A/master\n               ↓\n* -- * -- * -- a\n                \\\n                 * -- * -- b\n                           ↑\n                       B/mybranch\n\nNow, A is updated, so it looks like this:\n                          A/master\n                              ↓\n* -- * -- * -- a -- * -- * -- a+\n                \\\n                 * -- * -- b\n                           ↑\n                       B/mybranch\n\nNote here that you have two diverged branches that are not in a straight line. So saying that you would get a+ b a when you merge A onto B is not correct. You do get a merge, but that keeps the history as it is:\n                          A/master\n                              ↓\n* -- * -- * -- a -- * -- * -- a+\n                \\               \\\n                 * -- * -- b --- M\n                                 ↑\n                            B/mybranch\n\nAs you can see, you still have the information where the commits came from: The ones between a and a+ came from one branch, and the other ones between a and b came from another. And M combines those tro branches. Usually, this is exactly the proper way to solve this.\nThe benefit of this over rebasing—as you noticed yourself—is that the commits stay the way they are. All users who have interacted with either repository can simply pull those changes in without any problems. If you rebased any of those commits, they would have to manually fix that (chances are that they don’t even realize it, so they will just pull and actually create an even messier history with duplicate commits).\nSo a merge is definitely better to work with here. Yes, the history will not look as perfect as a straight line, but it properly conveys what has happened: There is a diverged development line which is independent and that has then been updated with the changes from the upstream repository A. This information can be useful and as such it makes sense to keep them in. And especially if you have users interacting with both those remotes, they will definitely prefer to keep their repository compatible with both remotes.\nIf you don’t want the history to look like this, and don’t care about compatibility with A, you could also squash all the changes from A onto your B:\n                          A/master\n                              ↓\n* -- * -- * -- a -- * -- * -- a+\n                \\\n                 * -- * -- b -- [A]\n                                 ↑\n                            B/mybranch\n\nHere, [A] is a squashed commit that contains all the changes between a and a+ in a single commit. You could get this result by rebasing A onto B while squashing all commits. In this case, you should clearly state where those changes come from in the commit message though."}]}

Also we have a develop branch where every developer merges his features. Sometimes we create a release branch to deploy our features in production. If we have a bug in the release branch, fix it and pull changes into the develop branch. If we have a critical bug in production, create new hotfix-branch, fix the bug and merge branch with production (master) and develop branches.\nThis approach works well if we seldom publish results of our work. (Maybe once every 2 weeks).\nGitHub Flow\n\nWe have a master branch as a production branch. And we (as developers) can  create branches for adding new features or fixing bugs and merge them with production (master) branch. It sounds very simple. This approach fits for extreme programming where the production branch is deployed several times in a day.\nGitLab Flow\n\n\n\nI've seen new terms like a pre-production, a production, a release (stable) branch and a staging environment, a pre-production environment, a production environment. What relationships do they have between them?\nI understand it this way: If we need to add a new feature we deploy a pre-production branch from the master branch. When we have finished the feature, we deploy a production branch from the pre-production branch. A pre-production branch is the intermediate stage. And then the master branch pulls all changes from the production branch.\nThe approach is good if we want to see each separate feature; we just checkout in the branch what we need to look at.\nBut if we need to show our work we create a release branch with a tag as late as possible. If later we fix bugs in the master branch we need to cherry-pick them to the last release branch. At the end we have the release branch with tags that can help us to move between versions.\nIs my understanding correct?\nWhat is the difference between pull and cherry-pick?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It has been a year now since this post was raised, but considering future readers and the fact things have changed a bit I think it's worth refreshing.\nGitHub Flow as originally depicted by Scott Chacon in 2011 assumed each change once reviewed on a feature branch and merged into master should be deployed to production immediately. While this worked at the time and conformed to the only GitHub Flow rule, which is anything in the master branch is deployable, it was quickly discovered that in order to keep master a true record of known working production code the actual deployment to production should happen from the feature branch before merging it into master. Deploying from the feature branch makes perfect sense as in the case of any issue production can be instantaneously reverted by deploying master to it. Please take a look at a short visual introduction to GitHub Flow.\nGitLab Flow is kind of an extension to GitHub Flow accompanied by a set of guidelines and best practices that aim to further standardize the process. Aside from promoting ready to deploy master branch and feature branches (same as GitHub Flow) it introduces three other kinds of branches:\n\nProduction branch\nEnvironment branches: uat, pre-production, production\nRelease branches: 1-5-stable, 1-6-stable\n\nI believe above names and examples are self-descriptive, thus I won't elaborate further."}]}

Older versions of Git suggested to use the command git reset HEAD <file>... instead of git restore --staged <file>.... You could also use git reset to unstage any and all files in the staging area (called the index). Restore command's equivalent is git restore --staged . (the dot is necessary and it specifies any file). Currently, any of those commands may be used and the outcome is the same. If you want to learn about the differences between those commands, check the documentation.\nSo let's do what Git suggests (without making and reverting any pointless commits):\n\nManually (or ideally using some merge tool, see below) resolve the conflict(s).\nUse git restore --staged . to mark conflict(s) as resolved and unstage all files in the staging area. If you want to unstage only specific files, use the command git restore --staged <file> instead. You don't have to execute git add before.\nFinally, remove the stash with git stash drop, because Git doesn't do that automatically on conflict.\n\nTranslated to the command-line commands:\n$ git stash pop\n\n# ...resolve conflict(s)\n\n$ git restore --staged .\n\n$ git stash drop\n\nExplanation of the default behavior\nThere are two ways of marking conflicts as resolved: git add and git restore --staged <file>.... While git restore --staged <file>... marks the conflicts as resolved and removes files from the index, git add also marks the conflicts as resolved, but keeps files in the index.\nAdding files to the index after a conflict is resolved is on purpose. This way you can differentiate the changes from the previous stash and changes you made after the conflict was resolved. If you don't like it, you can always use git restore --staged . to remove everything from the index.\nMerge tools\nI highly recommend using any of 3-way merge tools for resolving conflicts, e.g. KDiff3, Meld, etc., instead of doing it manually. It usually solves all or the majority of conflicts automatically itself. It's huge time-saver!"}]}

You should be making them once on your development machine and then running the same migrations on your colleagues’ machines, your staging machines, and eventually your production machines.\n\nIf you follow this process, you shouldn't be getting any merge conflicts in the migration files.\nWhen merging version control branches, you still may encounter a situation where you have multiple migrations based on the same parent migration, e.g. if two different developers introduced a migration concurrently. One way of resolving this situation is to introduce a merge_migration. Often this can be done automatically with the command\n./manage.py makemigrations --merge\n\nwhich will introduce a new migration that depends on all current head migrations. Of course this only works when there is no conflict between the head migrations, in which case you will have to resolve the problem manually.\n\nGiven that some people here suggested that you shouldn't commit your migrations to version control, I'd like to expand on the reasons why you actually should do so.\nFirst, you need a record of the migrations applied to your production systems. If you deploy changes to production and want to migrate the database, you need a description of the current state. You can create a separate backup of the migrations applied to each production database, but this seems unnecessarily cumbersome.\nSecond, migrations often contain custom, handwritten code. It's not always possible to automatically generate them with ./manage.py makemigrations.\nThird, migrations should be included in code review. They are significant changes to your production system, and there are lots of things that can go wrong with them.\nSo in short, if you care about your production data, please check your migrations into version control."}]}

I followed the countless other questions answering how to clean up your git repo and ended up using BFG to remove some bad commits. \nThis worked great, however, I noticed that after running a git count, there was a large amount of space sitting in garbage. So I ran a simple git gc. However, that did nothing to clean up the garbage. \nAfter some digging I found the following command:\ngit -c gc.reflogExpire=0 -c gc.reflogExpireUnreachable=0 -c gc.rerereresolved=0 \\\n-c gc.rerereunresolved=0 -c gc.pruneExpire=now gc \"$@\"\n\nRunning this led to the garbage being cleaned up locally.

Note that the method discards last commit from the repo - so you probably want to have its backup.\nBitbucket reported that our repo was about 2.1GB, while when cloned, it only took about 250MB locally. From this, we concluded that it's most likely from big files in unreachable commits (thanks to this answer).\nThis is how to see unreachable commits locally, where we don't take into account reachability via reflog:\ngit fsck --unreachable --no-reflog\nLocally, unreachable commits can be cleaned with:\ngit reflog expire --expire-unreachable=\"now\" --all\ngit prune --expire=\"now\" -v\ngit gc --aggressive --prune=\"now\"\n\nWe cannot however run any of these commands remotely on Bitbucket. But, they say on the page about reducing repo size (section Remove the repository limitation) that they run git gc themselves in response to doing git reset --hard HEAD~1 (which discards last commit) followed by git push -f. Also, they say in the section Garbage collecting dead data that one can try the sequence: git reflog expire --expire=now --all, git gc --prune=now, git push --all --force. Given all this, I decided to try the following locally, hoping it'd cut out the reflog and do a prune locally, and then push them to remote Bitbucket repository, on which it'd start a gc:\ngit reflog expire --expire-unreachable=\"30m\" --all\ngit prune --expire=\"30m\" -v\ngit gc --prune=\"30m\"\ngit reset --hard HEAD~1\ngit push -f\n\nThis worked, repo size immediately went from 2.1GB to ca. 250MB. :)\nNote that the time param to expire / expire-unreachable / prune sets the expiration cut-off point measuring from now back. So e.g. \"now\" means expire / prune everything, and \"30m\" means except for changes in last 30 minutes."}]}

Now if people commit their stuff locally and merge them later, you will have a hard time to come up with a consistent schema to form linearly increasing integer revisions. And even if you could, you would still get different result between different repos.\nIn the end, it's all because of the distributed nature.

It is surprisingly easy to do. Below is an example of one that I think should get you pretty close to the behavior you desire.\nFirst, create a merge driver script called merge-and-verify-driver. Make it executable and put it in a suitable location (you may want to consider checking this script into the repo, even, since the repo's config file is going to depend on it). Git is going to execute this shell script to perform the merge of the sensitive files:\n#!/bin/bash\ngit merge-file \"${1}\" \"${2}\" \"${3}\"\nexit 1\n\nThis just does the default merge behavior that Git itself normally does. The key difference is that the script always returns non-zero (to indicate that there was a conflict, even if the merge was actually resolved without conflicts).\nNext, you need to tell Git about the existence of your custom merge driver. You do this in the repo's config file (.git/config):\n[merge \"verify\"]\n        name = merge and verify driver\n        driver = ./merge-and-verify-driver %A %O %B\n\nIn this example, I've put merge-and-verify-driver in the repo's top level directory (./). You will need to specify the path to the script accordingly.\nNow, you just need to give the sensitive files the proper attributes so that the custom merge driver is used when merging those files. Add this to your .gitattributes file:\n*.sensitive merge=verify\n\nHere, I've told Git that any file with a name matching the pattern *.sensitive should use the custom merge driver. Obviously, you need to use pattern that is appropriate for your file(s)."}]}

When you click the connect button in the toolbar (looks like a power plug), make sure your repository is listed under Local Git Repositories, or use the clone option to clone a repository to your system.\n\nWhen you click clone you can enter an existing GitHub repository location, use the \"HTTPS\" location of your repository.

You can use the location picker on your GtiHub repository page to get the right clone url.\n\n\nThen finally, on the Unsynced Commits tab you can click Sync to synchronize your local repository with the remote, this will ask for your GitHub credentials.\n\nIf you want to create a new repository from scratch, I have not the slightest idea of how to do that from the UI, but after creating an empty repository on GitHub, you should be able to add a new remote from the commandline. Visual Studio will then pick up that remote and allow you to push into it.\nSee the following steps on github to initialize an empty repository and setup the link between your local repository and github. Once you've done that, the repository should show up in Visual Studio as well (if it doesn't, add it using the add option on the connect page of Team Explorer)."}]}

Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp\nand ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and\ndeprecated; do not use them). The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and\nshould be used with caution on unsecured networks. The following syntaxes may be used with them: ssh:// [ <user> @ ] <host> [ : <port> ] / <path-to-git-repo> git:// <host> [: <port> ] / <path-to-git-repo> http [ s ] :// <host> [ : <port> ] / <path-to-git-repo> ftp [ s ] :// <host> [ : <port> ] / <path-to-git-repo> An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol: [ <user> @ ] <host> :/ <path-to-git-repo> This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the\nfirst colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a\ncolon. For example the local path foo:bar could be specified as an\nabsolute path or ./foo:bar to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh\nurl. The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~ <username> expansion: ssh:// [ <user> @ ] <host> [ : <port> ] /~ <user> / <path-to-git-repo> git:// <host> [ : <port> ] /~ <user> / <path-to-git-repo> [ <user> @ ] <host> :~ <user> / <path-to-git-repo> For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following\nsyntaxes may be used: /path/to/repo.git/ file:///path/to/repo.git/ These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when\nthe former implies --local option. See git-clone for\ndetails. git clone , git fetch and git pull , but not git push , will also\naccept a suitable bundle file. See git-bundle . When Git doesn’t know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it\nattempts to use the remote- <transport> remote helper, if one\nexists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax\nmay be used: <transport> :: <address> where <address> may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary\nURL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being\ninvoked. See gitremote-helpers for details. If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and\nyou want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you\nuse will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a\nconfiguration section of the form: [url \" <actual-url-base> \"]\n\t\tinsteadOf = <other-url-base> For example, with this: [url \"git://git.host.xz/\"]\n\t\tinsteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/\n\t\tinsteadOf = work: a URL like \"work:repo.git\" or like \"host.xz:/path/to/repo.git\" will be\nrewritten in any context that takes a URL to be \"git://git.host.xz/repo.git\". If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a\nconfiguration section of the form: [url \" <actual-url-base> \"]\n\t\tpushInsteadOf = <other-url-base> For example, with this: [url \"ssh://example.org/\"]\n\t\tpushInsteadOf = git://example.org/ a URL like \"git://example.org/path/to/repo.git\" will be rewritten to\n\"ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git\" for pushes, but pulls will still\nuse the original URL."}]}

You have to enhance the needs with a if: always() configuration then.\n\n2. Separate workflow, using the workflow_run event as a trigger\nUsing the workflow_run event as a trigger we end up having 2 separate GitHub Actions workflow yaml files:\nbuild.yml\nname: CI build\n\non: [push]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Deploy Docker image to Google Cloud Run\n      run: ...\n\nnotify.yml\nname: CI notify\n\n# Only trigger, when the build workflow succeeded\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\"CI build\"]\n    types:\n      - completed\n\njobs:\n  notify:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Notify Slack and send eMail\n        run: ...\n\nA crucial point here is that the name: CI build definition of the first yaml file must exactly match the workflow_run: workflows: [\"CI build\"] definition in the second yaml file. Another point is that this approach needs to be done on the default branch (which is mostly main or master) as the docs state:\n\nNote: This event will only trigger a workflow run if the workflow file\nis on the default branch.\n\nHere's also a full example project using the 1st option if you're interested."}]}

I made sure to not forget to restart bash/IntelliJ after you changed config files.\n\nGenerate a new GPG key pair\nAdd the GPG key to my GitHub account\nAssociate a verified (by GitHub) email with my GPG key where I made sure the email in my .gitconfig is the same.\nTell Git about my GPG key\nSign a commit with GPG and confirmed that it was Verfied on Github.\nFrom that same page, I set commits to be signed by default with git config --global commit.gpgsign true (I'm using git 2.12). I made a new commit and verified it was signed with git verify-commit HEAD\nWhen I try to commit in IntelliJ, I get gpg: cannot open tty 'no tty' so I found IntelliJ fails to commit changes when attempting to sign commit (GPG) and added no-tty to my C:\\Users\\username\\.gnupg\\gpg.conf file and restarted. \nThen I get the error gpg: Sorry, no terminal at all requested - can't get input which seems reasonable because I just added the option that has something to do with no terminal. Like gpg: Sorry, no terminal at all requested - can't get input says the solution is to remove the no-tty which I hope doesn't apply to my case.\nOther answers in the first question suggested to add use-agent as well in the gpg.conf file, which results in the additional error gpg: gpg-agent is not available in this session. Ah wait, maybe I need to setup gpg-agent.\nThe best guide for Windows that I could find was the Archlinux wiki (yeah, right). It specifies to add to C:/Users/username/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf the time to live, so I create that file and add default-cache-ttl 34560000 and max-cache-ttl 34560000 as per \nhttps://superuser.com/questions/624343/keep-gnupg-credentials-cached-for-entire-user-session\nNow let's actually start this gpg-agent, https://superuser.com/questions/1153101/why-does-git-complain-that-no-gpg-agent-is-running made me check that indeed gpg-agent --version was much newer than gpg --version, so I would like to have gpg2 so I could run git config --global gpg.program gpg2.\nBut I do not have gpg2 available on the command line. I installed Gpg4win (binary releases, at the bottom) and even Gnupg 2 separately but that didn't give me gpg2 on the command line, I noticed I had to folder GNU in my Program Files (x86) which I think I should have. With where gpg I found out it was at least not pointing to the gpg I just downloaded, because that one showed second. So I pointed git to the right one with git config --global gpg.program 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuPG\\bin\\gpg.exe'\nNow I have the error gpg: skipped \"keyid\": secret key not available. The solution in gpg: skipped \"N\": secret key not available is what I just did, so that doesn't help. Then I realised I set everything up with the other gpg, not with this one. I did alias gpg=\"'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuPG\\bin\\gpg.exe'\", checked gpg --version and did the whole thing again. Actually I put the alias line in my .bash_profile so I don't need to run it every time.\nWhen I try gpg --gen-key it hangs immediately. No idea why, I don't think the problem is not enough entropy because the older gpg worked fine but it's possible that the newer version requires more entropy. In any case I couldn't find any windows user with the same problem on the Internet.\nIt works! When I commit in IntelliJ, it asks for my passphrase with pinentry only once. But now I can't commit from Git Bash, with the no secret key error which makes sense because as I said gpg --list-keys is empty: no key is associated with this gpg.\nIntellij IDEA signing GIT commits with GPG is relevant, but the only answer is for MAC and doesn't seem to apply to Windows. It did lead me to:\nme.m01.eu hints at adding a new environment variable called GNUPGHOME which points to C:\\Users\\username\\.gnupg. That directory exists, but as mentioned in an answer from git commit signing failed: secret key not available I think my new gpg uses C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\gnupg so I added that instead. I checked with printenv GNUPGHOME that I added it correctly (I had to reboot). Didn't change anything though.\nSince my keys are I think in C:\\Users\\username\\.gnupg I tried pointing the environment variable to there, but it didn't help, gpg --list-keys was still empty. So I had to find another way of pointing out to gpg where my keys are.\ngpg --list-keys --homedir='C:/Users/s156757/.gnupg' did give the correct keys, so I decided to add homedir C:\\Users\\s156757\\.gnupg to my C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\gnupg\\gpg.conf file which I had to create. Because of this bug. I confirmed gpg --list-keys returned my keys. Still the same error, adding no-ttyand use-agent to this conf file didn't help. \n\n\nI can now commit from within IntelliJ but not anymore with Git Bash, which results in skipped \"keyid\": No secret key.\n\nMore thoughts \n\nI didn't manage to export keys from gpg to gpg2 with gpg --export [ID] | gpg2 --import &&\ngpg --export-secret-keys [ID] | gpg2 --import\nI thought Gpg4win alone maybe could be configured so I don't need to type my password every time. Unfortunately, I couldn't find anywhere a way to make Gpg4win remember my passphrase.\nI later thought, if I remember correctly gpg --list-secret-keys has never returned anything for gpg 2. I only later found out that that command is different from gpg --list-keys.\n\nIn short this is the main problem: gpg-agent allows passphrase caching but the gpg version of git doesn't match the gpg-agent version so you have to install the right gpg 2 yourself first. But I didn't manage to do that installation in such a way that I could commit from both Git Bash and IntelliJ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since git 2.19.1, gpg2 is supported!\ngpg-agent can handle automatic signing now, remembering your passphrase\nThis should make it easier to use gpg to sign commits automatically.\nTo  be exact, git version 2.19.1 has at least gpg 2.2.9.\nThese instructions were tested on Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Arch Linux and Fedora 29.\nSteps to configure git commit signing\n\nIt is recommended that you have set up ssh, see e.g. help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh (also when you don't use GitHub)\nStart (on Linux) a terminal or (on Windows) git bash, check with git --version that git is at least 2.19.1 and with gpg --version that you are using gpg2.\n\nIf not, check with where gpg (or which gpg if the where command is not available) that the top-most path is the git one.\n\nIf you see no paths or not any one which has gpg2, try the gpg2 command instead of gpg, so gpg2 --version. If that works, you'll have to use gpg2 instead of gpg from now on.\nIf you see a git path but it's not the top one, put (on Windows) alias gpg=\"'C:\\path\\to\\Git\\usr\\bin\\gpg.exe'\" in your C:\\Users\\username\\.bash_profile, create the file if it doesn't exist, and restart git bash. Try where gpg and gpg --version again. From now on, where gpg is typed into a file you should replace it with 'C:\\path\\to\\Git\\usr\\bin\\gpg.exe'.\n\n\nCheck in the output of gpg --version if the home directory is something like (on Linux) /home/username/.gnupg or (on windows) /c/Users/username/.gnupg. This directory doesn't have to exist, yet.\n\nIf the path is incorrect, try to change it - for example one time on Windows I saw my home was prefixed by the path in which I ran the command, so I put an alias in the .bash_profile with alias gpg=\"gpg --homedir=/c/Users/username/.gnupg\" and restarted bash, then checked again.\n\nThe next few steps are from the good Github's guide, preferably you check there if commands are still correct. First, generate a new GPG key pair (but do not install the gnupg tools!): Run gpg --full-generate-key\n\n\nSelect RSA and RSA and 4096 bits.\nAs real name use your user.name as in your ~\\.gitconfig.\nAs email, use the email from user.email in your ~\\.gitconfig, making sure that this email is a verified email on GitHub.\nIf you want to try gpg-agent (you will have to provide your password at least once after each reboot) or if you are fine with an 'unverified' badge on GitHub, provide a password. Otherwise, leave it empty.\n\n\nEvery time your want to check what keys you have, use gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG. Do it now, and copy the key_id (as I will name your key from now on) from the output sec rsa4096/key_id 2018-10-27 [SC] ....\nPrint the public key with gpg --armor --export key_id.\nAdd the GPG key to your GitHub account: go to Settings | SSH and GPG keys and add the public key block (including the header and footer).\nTell Git about your GPG key in Settings > Version Control > Git > Configure GPG Key as shown in Mahozad's answer, please give it an upvote or tell git manually: git config --global user.signingkey key_id.\nIf you had to use the --homedir option before, you need to make sure that when git starts gpg, the home is also properly changed. Create a file C:\\Users\\username\\start-gpg.sh and put into it gpg --homedir=/c/Users/username/.gnupg \"$@\". Then run git config --global gpg.program C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\start-gpg.sh to tell git to use it.\nRestart bash.\nSign a commit with GPG with git commit -S -m \"signed commit\" and confirm that it is Verified on Github, you should see a little badge when you view your commit.\nSet commits to be signed by default with git config --global commit.gpgsign true. Make a new commit in IntelliJ and verify if it was signed with git verify-commit HEAD.\n\nSteps to make the commit signing happen automatically: three options\n1. I have no passphrase on my key\nYou're done.\n2. I want to try gpg-agent\nFor me this option didn't work: I still had to provide my passphrase often, though not always. But in theory this works:\n\nUpdate the cache time, in C:\\Users\\username\\.gnupg\\gpg-agent.conf: create file if it doesn't exist, add default-cache-ttl 34560000 and max-cache-ttl 34560000.\nRestart gpg-agent using gpgconf --kill gpg-agent\nNow you should have to enter your passphrase once when committing and then not anymore. Check that your commit is Verified on GitHub.\n\n3. Pipe the passphrase in plaintext to gpg\nThis means that you never have to provide your passphrase, but for me this means that GitHub puts an Unverified badge on my commit. Question here: The key whose key-id is in the signature did not sign this commit\n\nIf you created it already, replace all of the contents of C:\\Users\\username\\start-gpg.sh with the code below. If you didn't, create the file with the contents below, remove the --homedir flag and run git config --global gpg.program C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\start-gpg.sh. In any case, restart bash.\n\nYes, you're going to place your password in plaintext on your computer! If you know a better way, please leave a comment...\n# Passphrase-file-descriptor is set to 0 (STDIN), to use it --batch must be used\n# The --pinentry-mode loopback is required since gpg 2.1.0 for --passphrase-fd\n# The \"$@\" makes sure that whatever git wanted gpg to do, is still done\necho mypassphrase | gpg --homedir=/c/Users/username/.gnupg --passphrase-fd 0 --batch --yes --pinentry-mode loopback \"$@\"\n\n\nCommit and push and check that you were not asked for a passphrase, and that your commit is still Verified on GitHub.\n\nOld answer for older git versions without gpg2\nFor the reference, here are the full instructions, or rather the steps I did to make it somewhat work. With 'work' I mean that commits are signed automatically, but there are two disadvantages:\n\nGitHub recognizes them as unverified:\nThe key whose key-id is in the signature did not sign this commit. Someone may be trying to trick you.\nThe follow-up question regarding this is The key whose key-id is in the signature did not sign this commit\nCreating a commit takes a much longer time, like five seconds instead of less than one.\n\nIf you get stuck, check the steps in the question to see if I had the same problem.\n\nFirst few steps are from the good Github's guide: Generate a new GPG key pair\n\nAdd the GPG key to your GitHub account\n\nAssociate a verified (by GitHub) email with your GPG key and make sure the name and email in your .gitconfig are the same.\n\nTell Git about your GPG key\n\nSign a commit with GPG and confirm that it is Verified on Github, you should see a little badge when you view your commit.\n\nSet commits to be signed by default with git config --global commit.gpgsign true. Make a new commit and verify if it was signed with git verify-commit HEAD.\n\nThe gpg version that comes with git is too old, so install Gpg4win (binary releases, at the bottom) which should install gpg 2. With where gpg you should see two path, of which probably the second is your new gpg, something like C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuPG\\bin\\gpg.exe. If not, try to install Gnupg 2 separately from the downloads page.\n\nI put alias gpg=\"'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuPG\\bin\\gpg.exe'\" to point the gpg command to my new gpg in my C:\\Users\\username\\.bash_profile, restart Git Bash and check with gpg --version that I'm now using gpg 2.\n\nAdd a new environment variable called GNUPGHOME which points to C:\\Users\\username\\.gnupg. Reboot and check with printenv GNUPGHOME that you added it correctly.\n\nMake a script C:\\Users\\username\\gpg-no-tty.sh and put into it echo passphrase | \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuPG\\bin\\gpg.exe\" --passphrase-fd 0 --batch --no-tty --yes \"$@\"\n\n\nThe reason you are putting your passphrase in plaintext here is because the --batch option, which makes it all work, needs the passphrase fed. To me it seems like there should exist a better solution than saving your passphrase in plaintext on your computer, so please leave a comment if you found something better.\n\nPoint git to this script with git config --global gpg.program C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\gpg-no-tty.sh.\n\nNow test both in Git Bash and IntelliJ that you can commit, and verify that it worked by doing git verify-commit HEAD."}]}

Type 0 is invalid.\nDeltified representation\nConceptually there are only four object types: commit, tree, tag and\n  blob.\nHowever to save space, an object could be stored as a \"delta\" of\n  another \"base\" object.\n  These representations are assigned new types ofs-delta and ref-delta, which is only valid in a pack file.\nBoth ofs-delta and ref-delta store the \"delta\" to be applied to\n  another object (called 'base object') to reconstruct the object.\n  The difference between them is, \n\nref-delta directly encodes 20-byte base object name. \n  \n  \nIf the base object is in the same pack, ofs-delta encodes the offset of the base object in the pack instead.\n\n\nThe base object could also be deltified if it's in the same pack.\nRef-delta can also refer to an object outside the pack (i.e. the\n  so-called \"thin pack\"). When stored on disk however, the pack should\n  be self contained to avoid cyclic dependency.\nThe delta data is a sequence of instructions to reconstruct an object\n  from the base object.\n  If the base object is deltified, it must be converted to canonical form first. Each instruction appends more and more data to the target object until it's complete.\n  There are two supported instructions so far: \n\none for copy a byte range from the source object and \none for inserting new data embedded in the instruction itself.\n\nEach instruction has variable length. Instruction type is determined\n  by the seventh bit of the first octet. The following diagrams follow\n  the convention in RFC 1951 (Deflate compressed data format)."}]}

Maximum of 2 Gb per commit.\n\nSee git-lfs/wiki/Tutorial:\ngit lfs track '*.bin'\ngit add .gitattributes \"*.bin\"\ngit commit -m \"Track .bin files\"\n\n\nOriginal answer:\nRegarding what the git limitations with large files are, you can consider bup (presented in details in GitMinutes #24)\nThe design of bup highlights the three issues that limits a git repo:\n\nhuge files (the xdelta for packfile is in memory only, which isn't good with large files)\nhuge number of file, which means, one file per blob, and slow git gc to generate one packfile at a time.\nhuge packfiles, with a packfile index inefficient to retrieve data from the (huge) packfile.\n\n\nHandling huge files and xdelta\n\nThe primary reason git can't handle huge files is that it runs them through xdelta, which generally means it tries to load the entire contents of a file into memory at once.\nIf it didn't do this, it would have to store the entire contents of every single revision of every single file, even if you only changed a few bytes of that file.\nThat would be a terribly inefficient use of disk space, and git is well known for its amazingly efficient repository format.\n\n\nUnfortunately, xdelta works great for small files and gets amazingly slow and memory-hungry for large files.\nFor git's main purpose, ie. managing your source code, this isn't a problem.\n\n\nWhat bup does instead of xdelta is what we call \"hashsplitting.\"\nWe wanted a general-purpose way to efficiently back up any large file that might change in small ways, without storing the entire file every time.\nWe read through the file one byte at a time, calculating a rolling checksum of the last 128\nbytes.\n\n\nrollsum seems to do pretty well at its job. You can find it in bupsplit.c.\nBasically, it converts the last 128 bytes read into a 32-bit integer. What we then do is take the lowest 13 bits of the rollsum, and if they're all 1's, we consider that to be the end of a chunk.\nThis happens on average once every 2^13 = 8192 bytes, so the average chunk size is 8192 bytes.\nWe're dividing up those files into chunks based on the rolling checksum.\nThen we store each chunk separately (indexed by its sha1sum) as a git blob.\n\n\nWith hashsplitting, no matter how much data you add, modify, or remove in the middle of the file, all the chunks before and after the affected chunk are absolutely the same.\nAll that matters to the hashsplitting algorithm is the 32-byte \"separator\" sequence, and a single change can only affect, at most, one separator sequence or the bytes between two separator sequences.\nLike magic, the hashsplit chunking algorithm will chunk your file the same way every time, even without knowing how it had chunked it previously.\n\n\nThe next problem is less obvious: after you store your series of chunks as git blobs, how do you store their sequence?  Each blob has a 20-byte sha1 identifier, which means the simple list of blobs is going to be 20/8192 = 0.25% of the file length.\nFor a 200GB file, that's 488 megs of just sequence data.\n\n\nWe extend the hashsplit algorithm a little further using what we call \"fanout.\" Instead of checking just the last 13 bits of the checksum, we use additional checksum bits to produce additional splits.\nWhat you end up with is an actual tree of blobs - which git 'tree' objects are ideal to represent.\n\nHandling huge numbers of files and git gc\n\ngit is designed for handling reasonably-sized repositories that change relatively infrequently.  You might think you change your source code \"frequently\" and that git handles much more frequent changes than, say, svn can handle.\nBut that's not the same kind of \"frequently\" we're talking about.\n\n\nThe #1 killer is the way it adds new objects to the repository: it creates one file per blob.  Then you later run 'git gc' and combine those files into a single file (using highly efficient xdelta compression, and ignoring any files that are no longer relevant).\n\n\n'git gc' is slow, but for source code repositories, the resulting super-efficient storage (and associated really fast access to the stored files) is worth it.\n\n\nbup doesn't do that.  It just writes packfiles directly.\nLuckily, these packfiles are still git-formatted, so git can happily access them once\nthey're written.\n\nHandling huge repository (meaning huge numbers of huge packfiles)\n\nGit isn't actually designed to handle super-huge repositories.\nMost git repositories are small enough that it's reasonable to merge them all into a single packfile, which 'git gc' usually does eventually.\n\n\nThe problematic part of large packfiles isn't the packfiles themselves - git is designed to expect the total size of all packs to be larger than available memory, and once it can handle that, it can handle virtually any amount of data about equally efficiently.\nThe problem is the packfile indexes (.idx) files.\n\n\neach packfile (*.pack) in git has an associated idx (*.idx) that's a sorted list of git object hashes and file offsets.\nIf you're looking for a particular object based on its sha1, you open the idx, binary search it to find the right hash, then take the associated file offset, seek to that offset in the packfile, and read the object contents.\n\n\nThe performance of the binary search is about O(log n) with the number of hashes in the pack, with an optimized first step (you can read about it elsewhere) that somewhat improves it to O(log(n)-7).\nUnfortunately, this breaks down a bit when you have lots of packs.\n\n\nTo improve performance of this sort of operation, bup introduces midx (pronounced \"midix\" and short for \"multi-idx\") files.\nAs the name implies, they index multiple packs at a time."}]}

Thanks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TL;DR version: remote-tracking branch origin/master used to exist, but does not now, so local branch source is tracking something that does not exist, which is suspicious at best—it means a different Git feature is unable to do anything for you—and Git is warning you about it.  You have been getting along just fine without having the \"upstream tracking\" feature work as intended, so it's up to you whether to change anything.\nFor another take on upstream settings, see Why do I have to \"git push --set-upstream origin <branch>\"?\n\nThis warning is a new thing in Git, appearing first in Git 1.8.5.  The release notes contain just one short bullet-item about it:\n\n\n\"git branch -v -v\" (and \"git status\") did not distinguish among a\n  branch that is not based on any other branch, a branch that is in\n  sync with its upstream branch, and a branch that is configured with an\n  upstream branch that no longer exists.\n\n\nTo describe what it means, you first need to know about \"remotes\", \"remote-tracking branches\", and how Git handles \"tracking an upstream\".  (Remote-tracking branches is a terribly flawed term—I've started using remote-tracking names instead, which I think is a slight improvement.  Below, though, I'll use \"remote-tracking branch\" for consistency with Git documentation.)\nEach \"remote\" is simply a name, like origin or octopress in this case.  Their purpose is to record things like the full URL of the places from which you git fetch or git pull updates.  When you use git fetch remote,1 Git goes to that remote (using the saved URL) and brings over the appropriate set of updates.  It also records the updates, using \"remote-tracking branches\". \nA \"remote-tracking branch\" (or remote-tracking name) is simply a recording of a branch name as-last-seen on some \"remote\".  Each remote is itself a Git repository, so it has branches.  The branches on remote \"origin\" are recorded in your local repository under remotes/origin/.  The text you showed says that there's a branch named source on origin, and branches named 2.1, linklog, and so on on octopress.\n(A \"normal\" or \"local\" branch, of course, is just a branch-name that you have created in your own repository.)\nLast, you can set up a (local) branch to \"track\" a \"remote-tracking branch\".  Once local branch L is set to track remote-tracking branch R, Git will call R its \"upstream\" and tell you whether you're \"ahead\" and/or \"behind\" the upstream (in terms of commits).  It's normal (even recommend-able) for the local branch and remote-tracking branches to use the same name (except for the remote prefix part), like source and origin/source, but that's not actually necessary.\nAnd in this case, that's not happening.  You have a local branch source tracking a remote-tracking branch origin/master.\nYou're not supposed to need to know the exact mechanics of how Git sets up a local branch to track a remote one, but they are relevant below, so I'll show how this works.  We start with your local branch name, source.  There are two configuration entries using this name, spelled branch.source.remote and branch.source.merge.  From the output you showed, it's clear that these are both set, so that you'd see the following if you ran the given commands:\n$ git config --get branch.source.remote\norigin\n$ git config --get branch.source.merge\nrefs/heads/master\n\nPutting these together,2 this tells Git that your branch source tracks your \"remote-tracking branch\", origin/master.\nBut now look at the output of git branch -a, which shows all the local and remote-tracking branch names in your repository.  The remote-tracking names are listed under remotes/ ... and there is no remotes/origin/master.  Presumably there was, at one time, but it's gone now.\nGit is telling you that you can remove the tracking information with --unset-upstream.  This will clear out both branch.source.origin and branch.source.merge, and stop the warning.\nIt seems fairly likely that what you want, though, is to switch from tracking origin/master, to tracking something else: probably origin/source, but maybe one of the octopress/ names.\nYou can do this with git branch --set-upstream-to,3 e.g.:\n$ git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/source\n\n(assuming you're still on branch \"source\", and that origin/source is the upstream you want—there is no way for me to tell which one, if any, you actually want, though).\n(See also How do you make an existing Git branch track a remote branch?)\nI think the way you got here is that when you first did a git clone, the thing you cloned-from had a branch master.  You also had a branch master, which was set to track origin/master (this is a normal, standard setup for git).  This meant you had branch.master.remote and branch.master.merge set, to origin and refs/heads/master.  But then your origin remote changed its name from master to source.  To match, I believe you also changed your local name from master to source.  This changed the names of your settings, from branch.master.remote to branch.source.remote and from branch.master.merge to branch.source.merge ... but it left the old values, so branch.source.merge was now wrong.\nIt was at this point that the \"upstream\" linkage broke, but in Git versions older than 1.8.5, Git never noticed the broken setting.  Now that you have 1.8.5, it's pointing this out.\n\nThat covers most of the questions, but not the \"do I need to fix it\" one.  It's likely that you have been working around the broken-ness for years now, by doing git pull remote branch (e.g., git pull origin source).  If you keep doing that, it will keep working around the problem—so, no, you don't need to fix it.  If you like, you can use --unset-upstream to remove the upstream and stop the complaints, and not have local branch source marked as having any upstream at all.\nThe point of having an upstream is to make various operations more convenient.  For instance, git fetch followed by git merge will generally \"do the right thing\" if the upstream is set correctly, and git status after git fetch will tell you whether your repo matches the upstream one, for that branch.\nIf you want the convenience, re-set the upstream.\n\n1git pull uses git fetch, and as of Git 1.8.4, this (finally!) also updates the \"remote-tracking branch\" information.  In older versions of Git, the updates did not get recorded in remote-tracking branches with git pull, only with git fetch.  Since your Git must be at least version 1.8.5 this is not an issue for you.\n2Well, this plus a configuration line I'm deliberately ignoring that is found under remote.origin.fetch.  Git has to map the \"merge\" name to figure out that the full local name for the remote-branch is refs/remotes/origin/master.  The mapping almost always works just like this, though, so it's predictable that master goes to origin/master.\n3Or, with git config.  If you just want to set the upstream to origin/source the only part that has to change is branch.source.merge, and git config branch.source.merge refs/heads/source\nwould do it.  But --set-upstream-to says what you want done, rather than making you go do it yourself manually, so that's a \"better way\"."}]}

Additionaly, running \"pod install\" can't fetch my podspec file.\nWhat I have now is a main project, with a Podfile.

As far as I understand I DO have a podspec file in that gitlab path route.\nLook at this screenshot:\n\nThe URL scheme I'm using is the SSH flavoured one, that is the one appearing on the root of my gitlab project homepage (not the HTTP/HTTPS one). \nThis is a limitation of the project, so I can't use the HTTP one.\nOTOH I think my SSH credentials (and key setup) are stored ok on my machine. Why? because I try using a ssh shell against that URL, from the command line, and I can see \"Welcome myusername\" on screen without specifying any username and password (Then the gitlab machine logouts that shell for security reasons, but that's another theme. That's expected behaviour).\nWhatever, I'm still not sure what exact URL format/path should I use in my base app Podfile.\nInside gitlab I have my files and podspec file stored with the structure shown in the last screenshot, but I'm still not 100% sure if I've setup everything ok.\nThe contents of my commons.podspec file are these:\nPod::Spec.new do |s|\n\n  # 1\n  s.platform = :ios\n  s.ios.deployment_target = '8.0'\n  s.name = \"commons\"\n  s.summary = \"commons test fw via pod.\"\n  s.requires_arc = true\n\n  # 2\n  s.version = \"0.1.0\"\n\n  # 3\n  s.license = { :type => \"MIT\", :file => \"LICENSE\" }\n\n  # 4 - Replace with your name and e-mail address\n  s.author = { \"Me\" => \"[email protected]\" }\n\n\n  # 5 - Replace this URL with your own Github page's URL (from the address bar)\n  s.homepage = \"http://internal_ip_numeric_address_of_my_gitlab_machine:8888/myusername\"\n\n  # 6 - Replace this URL with your own Git URL from \"Quick Setup\"\n  s.source = { :git => \"http://internal_ip_numeric_address_of_my_gitlab_machine:8888/myusername/ios_commons_pod.git\", :tag => \"#{s.version}\"}\n\n  # 7\n  s.framework = \"UIKit\"\n  s.dependency 'RNCryptor'\n\n  # 8\n  s.source_files = \"commons/**/*.{swift}\"\n\n  # 9\n  s.resources = \"commons/**/*.{png,jpeg,jpg,xib,storyboard}\"\nend\n\nAny hint?\nThanks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The only thing you need to do is change :path => to :git => and it should download the pod from your repo."}]}

(without -o) does.)\nAs mentioned in the ls-files man page, --others is the important part, to show you non-cached, non-committed, normally ignored files.\n--exclude_standard is not just a shortcut, but a way to include all standard \"ignored patterns\" settings.\n\nexclude-standard\nAdd the standard git exclusions: .git/info/exclude, .gitignore in each directory, and the user's global exclusion file.\n\n\nGit 2.44 (Q1 2024), batch 13, clarifies the documentation where the --exclude-per-directory option was marked as deprecated, which confused readers into thinking there may be a plan to remove it in the future, which was not our intention.\nSee commit 0009542 (24 Jan 2024) by Junio C Hamano (gitster).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit bbc8c05, 02 Feb 2024)\n\nls-files: avoid the verb \"deprecate\" for individual options\n\n\nWhen e750951 (\"ls-files: guide folks to --exclude-standard over other --exclude* options\", 2023-01-13, Git v2.40.0-rc0 -- merge listed in batch #13) updated the documentation to give greater visibility to the --exclude-standard option, it marked the --exclude-per-directory option as \"deprecated\".\nWhile it is technically correct that being deprecated does not necessarily mean it is planned to be removed later, it seems to cause confusion to readers, especially when we merely mean\nThe option Y can be used to achieve the same thing as the option\nX much simpler. To those of you who aren't familiar with either\nX or Y, we would recommend to use Y when appropriate.\n\nThis is especially true for --exclude-standard vs the combination of more granular --exclude-from and --exclude-per-directory options.\nIt is true that one common combination of the granular options can be obtained by just giving the former, but that does not necessarily mean a more granular control is not necessary.\nState the reason why we recommend readers --exclude-standard in the description of --exclude-per-directory, instead of saying that the option is deprecated.\nAlso, spell out the recipe to emulate what --exclude-standard does, so that the users can give it minute tweaks (like \"do the same as Git Porcelain, except I do not want to read the global exclusion file from core.excludes\").\n\ngit ls-files now includes in its man page:\n\ndirectory and its subdirectories in .  If you are\ntrying to emulate the way Porcelain commands work, using\nthe --exclude-standard option instead is easier and more\nthorough.\n\ngit ls-files now includes in its man page:\n\nGenerally, you should be able to use --exclude-standard when you\nwant the exclude rules applied the same way as what Porcelain\ncommands do.  To emulate what --exclude-standard specifies, you\ncan give --exclude-per-directory=.gitignore, and then specify:\n\nThe file specified by the core.excludesfile configuration\nvariable, if exists, or the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore file.\n\nThe $GIT_DIR/info/exclude file.\n\n\nvia the --exclude-from= option."}]}

After the fetch, things look like this:\n- o - o - o - H - A - B - C (master)\n               \\\n                P - Q - R (origin/master)\n\nIf you merge at this point (the default behavior of git pull), assuming there aren't any conflicts, you end up with this:\n- o - o - o - H - A - B - C - X (master)\n               \\             /\n                P - Q - R --- (origin/master)\n\nIf on the other hand you did the appropriate rebase, you'd end up with this:\n- o - o - o - H - P - Q - R - A' - B' - C' (master)\n                          |\n                          (origin/master)\n\nThe content of your work tree should end up the same in both cases; you've just created a different history leading up to it. The rebase rewrites your history, making it look as if you had committed on top of origin's new master branch (R), instead of where you originally committed (H). You should never use the rebase approach if someone else has already pulled from your master branch. \nFinally, note that you can actually set up git pull for a given branch to use rebase instead of merge by setting the config parameter branch.<name>.rebase to true.

(In case someone wants to do an analysis on GitHub repositories… hint, hint.)\n\nMy point here is not to recommend the 50/72 style or shoot down other styles. (To be open about it, I do prefer it, but I am open to other ideas.) I just want to get the rationale for why people like or oppose various Git commit message styles.

I thought git merge --squash feature1 merged feature1 into mainline."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This happens because Git doesn't know that the squash merge is \"equivalent to\" the various branch-specific commits.  You must forcibly delete the branch, with git branch -D instead of git branch -d.\n(The rest of this is merely about why this is the case.)\nDraw the commit graph\nLet's draw (part of) the commit graph (this step is appropriate for so many things in Git...).  In fact, let's step back one more step, so that we start before your git rebase, with something like this:\n...--o--o--o     <-- mainline\n      \\\n       A--B--C   <-- feature1\n\nA branch name, like mainline or feature1, points only to one specific commit.  That commit points back (leftward) to a previous commit, and so on, and it's these backward pointers that form the actual branches.\nThe top row of commits, all just called o here, are kind of boring, so we didn't give them letter-names.  The bottom row of commits, A-B-C, are only on branch feature1.  C is the newest such commit; it leads back to B, which leads back to A, which leads back to one of the boring o commits.  (As an aside: the leftmost o commit, along with all earlier commits in the ... section, is on both branches.)\nWhen you ran git rebase, the three A-B-C commits were copied to new commits appended to the tip of mainline, giving us:\n...--o--o--o            <-- mainline\n      \\     \\\n       \\     A'-B'-C'   <-- feature1\n        \\\n         A--B--C       [old feature1, now abandoned]\n\nThe new A'-B'-C' commits are mostly the same as the original three, but they are moved in the graph.  (Note that all three boring o commits are on both branches now.)  Abandoning the original three means that Git usually doesn't have to compare the copies to the originals.  (If the originals had been reachable by some other name—a branch that appended to the old feature1, for instance—Git can figure this out, at least in most cases.  The precise details of how Git figures this out are not particularly important here.)\nAnyway, now you go on to run git checkout mainline; git merge --squash feature1.  This makes one new commit that is a \"squash copy\" of the three—or however many—commits that are on feature1.  I will stop drawing the old abandoned ones, and call the new squash-commit S for Squash:\n...--o--o--o--S         <-- mainline\n            \\\n             A'-B'-C'   <-- feature1\n\n\"Delete safety\" is determined entirely by commit history\nWhen you ask Git to delete feature1, it performs a safety check: \"is feature1 merged into mainline?\"  This \"is merged into\" test is based purely on the graph connectivity.  The name mainline points to commit S; commit S points back to the first boring o commit, which leads back to more boring o commits.  Commit C', the tip of feature1, is not reachable from S: we're not allowed to move rightward, only leftward.\nContrast this with making a \"normal\" merge M:\n...--o--o--o---------M   <-- mainline\n            \\       /\n             A'-B'-C'    <-- feature1\n\nUsing the same test—\"is the tip commit of feature1 reachable from the tip commit of mainline?\"—the answer is now yes, because commit M has a down-and-left link to commit C'.  (Commit C' is, in Git internal parlance, the second parent of merge commit M.)\nSince squash merges are not actually merges, though, there is no connection from S back to C'.\nAgain, Git doesn't even try to see if S is \"the same as\" A', B', or C'.  If it did, though, it would say \"not the same\", because S is only the same as the sum of all three commits.  The only way to get S to match the squashed commits is to have only one such commit (and in this case, there's no need to squash in the first place)."}]}

They are read-only, you cannot modify them (that's why a message appears when checking out). Although they reflect the state of a remote repo at the time of the last fetch or pull operation they are in fact stored locally.\nIf you do git checkout some-branch and some-branch does not yet exist but remotes/origin/some-branch exists, git will create a tracking branch called some-branch for you (1). Again this is a local operation, all data has been fetched before (or if you have not recently fetched, you will start working on an obsolete version). Originally the contents of the tracking branch is identical to its remote branch. However, the tracking branch can be modified by you locally.\nThe git working area contains the state of one branch at time. So your question about checking out all remote branches at once does not really make sense in the context of git. You can check out them one after each other. But each time you check out the next one, the previous one will disappear from the working area. Of course this operation can be scripted as shown in Track all remote git branches as local branches But what is the point of scripting a mass operation if only its last step is what remains? \nSo could the question be caused by a misunderstanding, assuming that remote branches would be only stored remotely, but not locally and you just wanted to make sure that you have everything local?  If you really want to have more than one branch checked out at a time you can clone your repo locally and checkout different branches into different work areas. (2)\nShortly: If you want to be sure that you have all data available locally that is in the\nremote repo just use git fetch [repo]. Unless you have tweaked with your configuration this will fetch all branches, i.e. updating existing remote branches and also creating new remote ones if applicable.\n(1) This is true in simple standard cases. In more complicated cases with more than 1 remote or manually configured remotes you might need the --track option to specify exactly what you want. \n(2) There is a new feature git worktree for this use case.

This might seem like a distinction without a difference—and for some commits, it is.  But for merge commits, it's not.\nWhen git show (or git log -p) shows a commit as a diff, it's doing so by comparing the commit's snapshot to something else.  The git diff command does the same thing: it compares one commit to another commit.  (Or it can compare a commit to the work-tree, or to the contents of the index, or a few other combinations as well.)\nFor ordinary commits, it's trivially obvious what to compare: compare this commit's snapshot to the previous (i.e., parent) commit's snapshot.  So that is what git show does (and git log -p too): it runs a git diff from the parent commit, to this commit.\nMerge commits don't have just one parent commit, though.  They have two parents.1  This is what makes them \"merge commits\" in the first place: the definition of a merge commit is a commit with at least two parents.\n\n1A merge commit can have three or more parents.  These are called \"octopus merges\".  They don't do anything special, though, and are mainly for showing off. :-)  You can ignore them here.\n\nWhen there are two parents, which one(s) should git show compare against?\nWhat git log -p chooses to do by default is not to compare at all.  You can make it show something by adding various flags (see below).\nWhat git show chooses to do by default is more complicated.  Since there are two parents, git show first compares against the \"first parent\",2 then compares against the second parent.  Then—this part is quite crucial—it combines the two diffs, producing a so-called \"combined diff\".\nFor the next section, let me note a tricky, but very useful, bit of Git syntax.  If you have a commit ID like c05f017, you can add a caret or \"hat\" character ^ after that, to name a parent commit.  You can optionally add another number to select which parent.  For regular (non-merge) commits there's only one, so c05f017^ is the parent.  For merge commits, c05f017^ and c05f017^1 both mean the first parent, while c05f017^2 means the second parent.\n\n2I put this in quotes because the first parent idea is especially important in Git, as we will see in a moment.  In other words, Git cares most about which parent is first, while the rest are just \"the rest\".\n\nCombined diffs\nThe combined diff format is described in the documentation, but a key bit is first described here, so as to make it especially obscure:3\n\nNote that combined diff lists only files which were modified from all parents.\n\nThat is, suppose M is a merge commit, and diffing M^1 vs M says file mainline.txt and common.txt were both changed.  Suppose further that diffing M^2 and M says that file sidebranch.txt and common.txt were both changed.  The combined diff will show only common.txt, skipping both mainline.txt and sidebranch.txt because those two files were only modified from one parent (each).  (Even then Git may show only some of the diffs for common.txt.)\n\n3It took me a long time to find this in the documentation, as I kept looking at the other section.\n\nSplitting the diffs\nThe -m option—m probably stands for merge here—tells Git to, in effect, \"split\" the merge.  That is, instead of trying to combine the diffs against each parent into one big combined diff, just show the diff against each parent, one diff at a time.\nThis is sometimes what you want.  When it's not what you want, you can run your own explicit git diff to just diff against one of the two parents (or see below).\nWhich parent should you diff against?\nUsually, the correct answer is \"the first parent\".\nThe key to the \"first parent\" notion is that when Git makes a merge commit, it always records the branch you're on at the time, as the first parent.  The other branch becomes the second parent.\nThat is, if you're on develop and you merge topic:\n$ git checkout develop\n$ git merge topic\n\nGit will make a new commit—a merge commit, with two parents—on your current branch, develop.  The first parent of the merge commit will be the commit that was the tip of develop just a moment ago.  The second parent will be the commit that is (still) the tip of topic.\nSince you're usually concerned with what the merge brought in, comparing against the first parent will give you that.  So usually that's what you want.  For this reason, git show allows you to run git show --first-parent.  That \"splits\" the commit and then git show only diffs against the first parent.  (This is a bit different than git show -m, which splits the commit twice: the first split compares against the first parent, and the second split compares against the second parent.)\nSimilarly, you can run git log -p --first-parent Here, the --first-parent flag has an even more important effect: the log operation does not look at any of the side branch's commits at all, only those on the main (first-parent) line.  Note that if your Git is older than 2.31, you still need the -m flag as well (when using git log, that is; git show defaults to --cc and hence does not require the -m, and all of this was cleaned up in Git 2.31)."}]}

If not, you're in the most common use case for git stash:\ngit stash\ngit checkout other-branch\ngit stash pop\n\nThe first stash hides away your changes (basically making a temporary commit), and the subsequent stash pop re-applies them. This lets Git use its merge capabilities.\nIf, when you try to pop the stash, you run into merge conflicts... the next steps depend on what those conflicts are. If all the stashed changes indeed belong on that other branch, you're simply going to have to sort through them - it's a consequence of having made your changes on the wrong branch.\nOn the other hand, if you've really messed up, and your work tree has a mix of changes for the two branches, and the conflicts are just in the ones you want to commit back on the original branch, you can save some work. As usual, there are a lot of ways to do this. Here's one, starting from after you pop and see the conflicts:\n# Unstage everything (warning: this leaves files with conflicts in your tree)\ngit reset\n\n# Add the things you *do* want to commit here\ngit add -p     # or maybe git add -i\ngit commit\n\n# The stash still exists; pop only throws it away if it applied cleanly\ngit checkout original-branch\ngit stash pop\n\n# Add the changes meant for this branch\ngit add -p\ngit commit\n\n# And throw away the rest\ngit reset --hard\n\nAlternatively, if you realize ahead of the time that this is going to happen, simply commit the things that belong on the current branch. You can always come back and amend that commit:\ngit add -p\ngit commit\ngit stash\ngit checkout other-branch\ngit stash pop\n\nAnd of course, remember that this all took a bit of work, and avoid it next time, perhaps by putting your current branch name in your prompt by adding $(__git_ps1) to your PS1 environment variable in your bashrc file.

This operation changes the commit history.\ngit reset can also be used to restore the index, overlapping with git restore.\n\n\nSo:\n\nTo restore a file in the index to match the version in HEAD (this is the same as using git-reset)\ngit restore --staged hello.c\n\nor you can restore both the index and the working tree (this the same as using git-checkout)\ngit restore --source=HEAD --staged --worktree hello.c\n\nor the short form which is more practical but less readable:\ngit restore -s@ -SW hello.c\n\n\n\nWith Git 2.25.1 (Feb. 2020), \"git restore --staged\" did not correctly update the cache-tree structure, resulting in bogus trees to be written afterwards, which has been corrected.\nSee discussion.\nSee commit e701bab (08 Jan 2020) by Jeff King (peff).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 09e393d, 22 Jan 2020) \n\nrestore: invalidate cache-tree when removing entries with --staged\nReported-by: Torsten Krah\nSigned-off-by: Jeff King\nWhen \"git restore --staged \" removes a path that's in the index, it marks the entry with CE_REMOVE, but we don't do anything to invalidate the cache-tree.\n  In the non-staged case, we end up in checkout_worktree(), which calls remove_marked_cache_entries(). That actually drops the entries from the index, as well as invalidating the cache-tree and untracked-cache.\nBut with --staged, we never call checkout_worktree(), and the CE_REMOVE entries remain. Interestingly, they are dropped when we write out the index, but that means the resulting index is inconsistent: its cache-tree will not match the actual entries, and running \"git commit\" immediately after will create the wrong tree.\nWe can solve this by calling remove_marked_cache_entries() ourselves before writing out the index. Note that we can't just hoist it out of checkout_worktree(); that function needs to iterate over the CE_REMOVE entries (to drop their matching worktree files) before removing them.\nOne curiosity about the test: without this patch, it actually triggers a BUG() when running git-restore:\nBUG: cache-tree.c:810: new1 with flags 0x4420000 should not be in cache-tree\n\nBut in the original problem report, which used a similar recipe, git restore actually creates the bogus index (and the commit is created with the wrong tree). I'm not sure why the test here behaves differently than my out-of-suite reproduction, but what's here should catch either symptom (and the fix corrects both cases).\n\n\nWith Git 2.27 (Q2 2020), \"git restore --staged --worktree\" now defaults to take the contents out of \"HEAD\", instead of erring out.\nSee commit 088018e (05 May 2020) by Eric Sunshine (sunshineco).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 4c2941a, 08 May 2020) \n\nrestore: default to HEAD when combining --staged and --worktree\nSigned-off-by: Eric Sunshine\nReviewed-by: Taylor Blau\nBy default, files are restored from the index for --worktree, and from HEAD for --staged. \nWhen --worktree and --staged are combined, --source must be specified to disambiguate the restore source, thus making it cumbersome to restore a file in both the worktree and the index.\n(Due to an oversight, the --source requirement, though documented, is not actually enforced.)\nHowever, HEAD is also a reasonable default for --worktree when combined with --staged, so make it the default anytime --staged is used (whether combined with --worktree or not).\n\nSo now, this works:\ngit restore --staged --worktree\ngit restore -SW"}]}

The -p option uses the -i mechanism internally, so mixing the two doesn't really work.\nHowever, git rebase is just an automated way to do lots of cherry-picks.  You can replicate its behavior by manually cherry-picking to get a bit more control over the process.  It's less convenient and more prone to human error, but possible.\nThis is the approach I suggest:\n\nuse git rebase to get to the commit after the merge (the child of the merge)\nuse git reset --hard HEAD^ to manually get to the merge\nuse git commit --amend to repair the merge\nuse git cherry-pick to get back to the commit after the merge\nuse git rebase --continue to finish\n\nHere are the specific steps:\n\nNote the SHA1 ID of the merge commit you want to modify.  For discussion, suppose it is deadbeef.\nNote the SHA1 ID of the commit right after the merge commit you want to modify (the merge commit's child).  Suppose it is facef00d.\nRun git rebase -i deadbeef.\nSelect facef00d for editing.\nWhen rebase returns you to a prompt to edit facef00d, run git reset --hard HEAD^.  You should now be at deadbeef (git rev-parse HEAD should print deadbeef).\nMake your edits to fix the incorrect merge conflict and use git add to stage them.\nRun git commit --amend to fuse the staged fix with the bad merge commit.  The result will now have a different SHA1 (not deadbeef).\nRun git cherry-pick facef00d to apply the changes made by facef00d to the fixed merge commit.\nRun git rebase --continue to finish."}]}

I have used git settings found on http://shanesbrain.net/2008/7/9/using-xcode-with-git for my workflow so far.\nThose settings tell git to exclude *.pbxproj from merges?  Is there a real reason for doing this?  For example, when I add a file to the project and push to origin, my fellow developers will not have that file added to their xcode project when they pull.  Then if one of them builds a release this file may not be included.  Shouldn't I just let git handle the merges for the project file?  Why or why not this file should be in merges and how to properly handle the situation when files are added to the project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have worked on iPhone applications full time since the SDK launch, most of that time spent working on teams with multiple developers.\nThe truth is that it's way more harmful to disallow merging of that .pbxproj file than it is helpful.  As you say, when you add a file unless other people get that file, they have to also add it to their project - in an application of any size, that sucks and it also takes away a huge benefit of source code control in that you cannot really revert to a complete earlier project state just through git.\nThe .pbxproj file is simply a property list (similar to XML).  From experience, just about the ONLY merge conflict you were ever get is if two people have added files at the same time.  The solution in 99% of the merge conflict cases is to keep both sides of the merge, which for git at least simply involves removing any >>>>, <<<<, and ==== lines.  In fact this is so common that I have created a simple shell script to fix a .pbxproj file in a merge state from git, I run this from within the project directory (at the Classes level):\n#!/bin/sh\n\n    projectfile=`find -d . -name 'project.pbxproj'`\n    projectdir=`echo *.xcodeproj`\n    projectfile=\"${projectdir}/project.pbxproj\"\n    tempfile=\"${projectdir}/project.pbxproj.out\"\n    savefile=\"${projectdir}/project.pbxproj.mergesave\"\n\n    cat $projectfile | grep -v \"<<<<<<< HEAD\" | grep -v \"=======\" | grep -v \"^>>>>>>> \" > $tempfile\n    cp $projectfile $savefile\n    mv $tempfile $projectfile\n\nWorst case if it fails (you ask XCode to load the project and it fails to load), you simply delete the .pbxproj file, check out the master from git, and re-add your files.  But I've never had that happen in many months of use with this script, again working full time on iPhone applications with several other developers.\nAnother option (pointed out in comments below) that you can try using in place of the script, is to add this line to a .gitattributes file:\n*.pbxproj text -crlf -diff -merge=union\n\nThen git will always take both sides of a merge for the .pbxproject files, having the same effect as the script I provided only without any extra work.\nLastly, here is my complete .gitignore file, showing what I do have it set to ignore as there are a few things you don't want - in my case really just emacs remnants and the whole build directory:\n# xcode noise\nbuild/*\n*.pbxuser\n*.mode1v3\n*~\n\n# old skool\n.svn\n\n# osx noise\n.DS_Store\nprofile"}]}

Working with these repositories also\nbecomes somewhat similar to SVN workflows, with the addition that one\ncan use local commits and branches:\nsvn checkout   --> git clone\nsvn update     --> git pull\nsvn commit     --> git push\n\nYou can have multiple remotes in each working clone, for the ease of\nsynchronizing between the multiple parties:\n$ cd ~/dev\n$ git clone /repos/foo.git       # or the one from github, ...\n$ cd foo\n$ git remote add github ...\n$ git remote add memorystick ...\n\nYou can then fetch/pull from each of the \"sources\", work and commit\nlocally, and then push (\"backup\") to each of these remotes when you\nare ready with something like (note how that pushes the same commits\nand history to each of the remotes!):\n$ for remote in origin github memorystick; do git push $remote; done\n\nThe easiest way to turn an existing working repository ~/dev/foo\ninto such a bare repository is probably:\n$ cd ~/dev\n$ git clone --bare foo /repos/foo.git\n$ mv foo foo.old\n$ git clone /repos/foo.git\n\nwhich is mostly equivalent to a svn import--but does not throw the\nexisting, \"local\" history away.\nNote: submodules are a mechanism to include shared related\nlineages, so I indeed wouldn't consider them an appropriate tool for\nthe problem you are trying to solve."}]}

A pull effectively runs git fetch and then git merge so a merge is usually happening when you run git pull.\nThe alternative to use rebasing instead of merging is possible, but usually you should avoid it. Rebasing allows you to keep a linear history, but also removes any information about the branching that originally happened. It will also cause the history of the current branch being rewritten, recreating all commits that are not contained in the target branch (in your case, the remote). As the recreated commits are different commits, this can cause a lot of confusion when developing together with others, especially when people already checked out parts of those commits before they get rewritten (for example with feature branches). So as a rule of thumb, you should never rewrite any commit that was already pushed.\nThe commits you see are there to combine two (or more) branches. It is perfectly fine to have a commit that does nothing else then merging multiple branches. In fact it makes it very clear when you have a merge commit that combines branches when looking at the history. In comparison to rebasing, merging also allows you to effectively see the original history as it was developed, including the actual branches that coexisted.\nSo, long story short: Yes, having merge commits is perfectly fine and you should not worry about them."}]}

When it refers to files, I'm not\nsure if it's still considered \"tree-ish\", or if acts more like \"blob-ish\" (Git\nrefers to files as \"blobs\").\nThe Long Answer\nCommits and Directory Trees in Git\nAt its lowest levels, Git keeps track of source code using four fundamental\nobjects:\n\nAnnotated tags, which point to commits.\nCommits, which point to the root directory tree of your project.\nTrees, which are directories and subdirectories.\nBlobs, which are files.\n\nEach of these objects has its own sha1 hash ID, since Linus Torvalds designed\nGit like an content- addressable filesystem, i.e. files can be retrieved\nbased on their content (sha1 IDs are generated from file content). The Pro Git\nbook gives this example diagram:\n\nCommit-ish vs Tree-ish\nMany Git commands can accept special identifiers for commits and (sub)directory\ntrees:\n\n\"Commit-ish\" are identifiers that ultimately lead to a commit object. For example,\ntag -> commit\n\"Tree-ish\" are identifiers that ultimately lead to tree (i.e. directory) objects.\ntag -> commit -> project-root-directory\n\nBecause commit objects always point to a directory tree object (the root\ndirectory of your project), any identifier that is \"commit-ish\" is, by\ndefinition, also \"tree-ish\". In other words, any identifier that leads to a\ncommit object can also be used to lead to a (sub)directory tree object.\nBut since directory tree objects never point to commits in Git's versioning\nsystem, not every identifier that points to a (sub)directory tree can also be\nused to point to a commit. In other words, the set of \"commit-ish\" identifiers\nis a strict subset of the set of \"tree-ish\" identifiers.\nThe set of tree-ish identifiers that cannot be used as commit-ish are\n\n<rev>:<path>, which leads directly to directory trees, not commit\nobjects. For example, HEAD:subdirectory.\nSha1 identifiers of directory tree objects."}]}

Also there is this issue on GitLab itself that provides some insights.\nMy Situation\nI installed and now administer a few instances of GitLab for a few small developer teams as well as one for my personal projects. Resultingly, I have run into numerous questions about this. I keep coming back to this question only to realize that it was never actually answered correctly.\nThe Namespace Problem\nThe issue that you face when doing this is that there can only be one owner of a project, but to transfer a project you have to own the namespace that you are transferring it to. To my knowledge there is no other way to move a project. For completeness, I'll add that the namespace here is, e.g., \"gitlab.com/my-user-name/...\" or \"gitlab.com/my-group-name/...\".\n\nSolution\nBecause one user cannot \"own\" another namespace (not even admins), the only option to set up a scenario where two users own the same namespace is with a group. Perform the following steps to accomplish this.\n\nCreate a new group.\nAdd the user that you want to transfer your project to as an owner member of that group.\nTransfer your project to that group (a namespace you manage because you are an owner).\nLogin as the other user, then transfer the group project to the \"other user\" namespace.\n\nAt this point you will be left as a master in the project.

The page for Issue comments confirms this:\n\nThe Issue Comments API supports listing, viewing, editing, and creating comments on issues and pull requests.\n\nSo, the request you need to make is:\nPOST /repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:number/comments\n\nHow do you know which issue comment URL to POST to? Well, if you look at the response for getting a single pull request, you will see that it contains an attribute called _links, and that this attribute has a nested comments attribute. This is the URL which you should use for reading and creating pull request comments, the same one as to be used in the POST request above."}]}

Combined with TortoiseSVN, I can't really imagine how it could be any better.  \nYet there's a growing number of developers claiming that Subversion has problems and that we should be moving to the new breed of distributed version control systems, such as Git.  \nHow does Git improve upon Subversion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Git is not better than Subversion. But is also not worse. It's different.\nThe key difference is that it is decentralized. Imagine you are a developer on the road, you develop on your laptop and you want to have source control so that you can go back 3 hours.\nWith Subversion, you have a Problem: The SVN Repository may be in a location you can't reach (in your company, and you don't have internet at the moment), you cannot commit. If you want to make a copy of your code, you have to literally copy/paste it.\nWith Git, you do not have this problem. Your local copy is a repository, and you can commit to it and get all benefits of source control. When you regain connectivity to the main repository, you can commit against it.\nThis looks good at first, but just keep in mind the added complexity to this approach.\nGit seems to be the \"new, shiny, cool\" thing. It's by no means bad (there is a reason Linus wrote it for the Linux Kernel development after all), but I feel that many people jump on the \"Distributed Source Control\" train just because it's new and is written by Linus Torvalds, without actually knowing why/if it's better.\nSubversion has Problems, but so does Git, Mercurial, CVS, TFS or whatever.\nEdit: So this answer is now a year old and still generates many upvotes, so I thought I'll add some more explanations. In the last year since writing this, Git has gained a lot of momentum and support, particularly since sites like GitHub really took off. I'm using both Git and Subversion nowadays and I'd like to share some personal insight.\nFirst of all, Git can be really confusing at first when working decentralized. What is a remote? and How to properly set up the initial repository? are two questions that come up at the beginning, especially compared to SVN's simple \"svnadmin create\", Git's \"git init\" can take the parameters --bare and --shared which seems to be the \"proper\" way to set up a centralized repository. There are reasons for this, but it adds complexity. The documentation of the \"checkout\" command is very confusing to people changing over - the \"proper\" way seems to be \"git clone\", while \"git checkout\" seems to switch branches.\nGit REALLY shines when you are decentralized. I have a server at home and a Laptop on the road, and SVN simply doesn't work well here. With SVN, I can't have local source control if I'm not connected to the repository (Yes, I know about SVK or about ways to copy the repo). With Git, that's the default mode anyway. It's an extra command though (git commit commits locally, whereas git push origin master pushes the master branch to the remote named \"origin\").\nAs said above: Git adds complexity. Two modes of creating repositories, checkout vs. clone, commit vs. push... You have to know which commands work locally and which work with \"the server\" (I'm assuming most people still like a central \"master-repository\").\nAlso, the tooling is still insufficient, at least on Windows. Yes, there is a Visual Studio AddIn, but I still use git bash with msysgit.\nSVN has the advantage that it's MUCH simpler to learn: There is your repository, all changes to towards it, if you know how to create, commit and checkout and you're ready to go and can pickup stuff like branching, update etc. later on.\nGit has the advantage that it's MUCH better suited if some developers are not always connected to the master repository. Also, it's much faster than SVN. And from what I hear, branching and merging support is a lot better (which is to be expected, as these are the core reasons it was written).\nThis also explains why it gains so much buzz on the Internet, as Git is perfectly suited for Open Source projects: Just Fork it, commit your changes to your own Fork, and then ask the original project maintainer to pull your changes. With Git, this just works. Really, try it on Github, it's magic.\nWhat I also see are Git-SVN Bridges: The central repository is a Subversion repo, but developers locally work with Git and the bridge then pushes their changes to SVN.\nBut even with this lengthy addition, I still stand by my core message: Git is not better or worse, it's just different. If you have the need for \"Offline Source Control\" and the willingness to spend some extra time learning it, it's fantastic. But if you have a strictly centralized Source Control and/or are struggling to introduce Source Control in the first place because your co-workers are not interested, then the simplicity and excellent tooling (at least on Windows) of SVN shine."}]}

For instance, if E fixes a typo that you made in A, you can do this:\npick A Commit message A\nfixup E Commit message E\npick B Commit message B\npick C Commit message C\npick D Commit message D\n\nHowever, when you reorder commits, you run the risk of having to resolve conflicts along the way.

There are some restrictions on added work-trees that make them somewhat annoying for this kind of work-flow, but it can work, and is built in to modern Git.\nNote that if you do do something like I describe below, git gc won't know to look in your alternate index files, and in fact, from its original introduction in Git 2.5 until it was fixed in Git 2.15, git gc forgot to check added work-trees and their index files!\nSee VonC's answer for more.\n\nYou can in fact have multiple different staging areas (more literally, multiple index files) in git.  To achieve the effect you want you would have to write your own variant of git add -p anyway, so what I will do here is sketch an outline, as it were, of how to do this.\nThe default index file—the one git uses if you don't direct it to some other index file—lives in .git/index (or, more shell-correctly, $GIT_DIR/.index where $GIT_DIR is taken from the environment or, if not set there, from git rev-parse --git-dir).\nIf you set the environment variable GIT_INDEX_FILE, however, git will use that file instead as the index.  Thus, you might begin your \"scatter changes to four branches\" process by doing something like this:\nGIT_DIR=${GIT_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --git-dir)} || exit 1\nindex_tmp_dir=$(mktemp -d) || exit 1\ntrap \"rm -rf $index_tmp_dir\" 0 1 2 3 15 # clean up on exit\n\n# make four copies of initial staging area\nfor f in i1 i2 i3 i4; do\n    cp $GIT_DIR/index $index_tmp_dir/$f\ndone\n\n# THIS IS THE HARD PART:\n# Now, using `git diff-files -p` or similar, get patches\n# (diff hunks).\n# Whenever you're ready to stage one, pick an index for it,\n# then use:\nGIT_INDEX_FILE=$index_tmp_dir/$which git apply --cached < diffhunk\n\n# Once done, commit each index file separately with some\n# variation on:\nfor f in i1 i2 i3 i4; do\n    GIT_INDEX_FILE=$index_tmp_dir/$which git commit\ndone\n\nFor the part labeled \"hard part\", your best bet might well be to copy git's add-interactive perl script, found in $(git --exec-path)/git-add--interactive, then modify it to suit.  To remove the \"exactly four commits\" restriction, make this modified interactive-add create a new index file dynamically (by copying the original, or perhaps creating an \"empty\" index equal to the HEAD commit or whatever; see git read-tree as well).\nEdit: the some variation on section really should almost certainly use git write-tree and git commit-tree to make new branches out of each of these commits, using the parent of the current commit as their parent, rather than allowing git commit to string the commits together as a linear chain.  That means one must also choose some naming scheme for these various newly-created branches."}]}

Why not clone the original repository to my machine, add my code, then push the new branch to GitHub and make a pull request?\n\nUnless you have write access to the repository in question, you cannot simply push anything to it; your push will be denied by the server with an error message of the form\nremote: Permission to bos/text.git denied to Jubobs.\nfatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/bos/text/': The requested URL returned error: 403\n\nThat's where a fork comes into play. By forking someone else's repo, you get a copy to which you have write access, i.e. to which you can push your contributions. The entire workflow goes something like this:\n\nIdentify an area in Alice's repo that can be improved.\nFork that repo.\nMake a clone of your fork on your local machine.\nIn that clone, make changes, run tests, create commits (possibly on a new branch), etc.\nOptionally, once you're happy with your amendments to Alice's code, make your work more presentable: tidy/squash your commits, write good commit messages that respect the style of Alice's repo. You may also want to rebase your branch to that of Alice's branch, if Alice has pushed changes to her repo since you forked her repo.\nPush to your fork.\nIssue a pull request to Alice (essentially notifying Alice to take a look at the changes you made in your fork of her repo) and wait for her to review it.\nPush more commits to (and possibly rebase) your branch until Alice is satisfied with your work.\nIf all goes well, Alice merges your pull request; your work gets integrated into her GitHub repo. Champagne! Your work was not in vain.\nIf you don't intend to contribute to Alice's repo any time soon, you can safely delete your fork, to save space on GitHub's servers. If, on the other hand, you frequently contribute to Alice's repo, keep your fork and frequently sync it with Alice's repo."}]}

(After the setting, you can use environment variables like this in your project.)\nconst apiKey = process.env.REACT_APP_APIKey\nconst apiSecret = process.env.REACT_APP_APISecret\n\nTo add a secret to your repository, go to your repository's Setting > Secrets, click on Add a new secret.

(You can access the secret you set in the script by ${{ secrets.REACT_APP_APIKey }}.)\nname: CI\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n\njobs:\n  build:\n\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    \n    - name: Checkout\n      uses: actions/checkout@v1\n\n    - name: Build\n      run: |\n        npm install\n        npm run-script build\n      env:\n        REACT_APP_APIKey: ${{ secrets.REACT_APP_APIKey }}\n        REACT_APP_APISecret: ${{ secrets.REACT_APP_APISecret }}\n\n    - name: Deploy\n      uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@releases/v3\n      with:\n        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        BRANCH: gh-pages\n        FOLDER: build\n\n\nAfter you setup the script, the action will be triggered by any push to master\nbranch.

Don't create a pull request from master, where you could be tempted to accumulate and mix several modifications at once.\nrebase that branch: even if you already did a pull request from that branch, rebasing it on top of origin/master (making sure your patch is still working) will update the pull request automagically (no need to click on anything)\nupdate that branch: if your pull request is rejected, you simply can add new commits, and/or redo your history completely: it will activate your existing pull request again.\n\"focus\" that branch: i.e., make its topic \"tight\", don't modify thousands of class and the all app, only add or fix a well-defined feature, keeping the changes small.\ndelete that branch: once accepted, you can safely delete that branch on your fork (and git remote prune origin). The GitHub GUI will propose for you to delete your branch in your pull-request page.\n\nNote: to write the Pull-Request itself, see \"How to write the perfect pull request\" (January 2015, GitHub)\n\nMarch 2016: New PR merge button option: see \"Github squash commits from web interface on pull request after review comments?\".\n\nThe maintainer of the repo can choose to merge --squash those PR commits.\n\nAfter a Pull Request\nRegarding the last point, since April, 10th 2013, \"Redesigned merge button\", the branch is deleted for you:\n\n\nDeleting branches after you merge has also been simplified.\nInstead of confirming the delete with an extra step, we immediately remove the branch when you delete it and provide a convenient link to restore the branch in the event you need it again.\n\nThat confirms the best practice of deleting the branch after merging a pull request.\n\npull-request vs. request-pull\n\npull request isn't an official \"git\" term.\nGit uses the request-pull(!) command to build a request for merging:\nIt \"summarizes the changes between two commits to the standard output, and includes the given URL in the generated summary.\"\nGithub launches its own version on day one (February 2008), but redesigned that feature in May 2010, stating that:\n  Pull Request = Compare View + Issues + Commit comments\n\n\n\n\ne-notes for \"reposotory\" (sic)\n<humour>\nThat (pull request) isn't even defined properly by GitHub!\nFortunately, a true business news organization would know, and there is an e-note in order to replace pull-replace by 'e-note':\n\nSo if your reposotory needs a e-note... ask Fox Business.

And it sounds pretty cool so in order to learn more about it, I looked it up on Wikipedia.\n\nTravis CI is a hosted, distributed continuous integration service\n  used to build and test projects hosted at GitHub. Travis CI automatically detects when a commit has been made and pushed to a GitHub repository that is using Travis CI, and each time this happens, it will try to build the project and run tests. This includes commits to all branches, not just to the master branch.\n\nMy current understanding of Travis CI is that what it does is automatically pushing the project upon git commit -am \"..\" and I don't quite understand some part of it.\n\nBy building the project and run tests, what tests is it going to run? And how is it going to \"build\" the project? (like compiling it to binary?)\nIt states that \"This includes commits to all branches\" - but what if I don't want to commit to all branches?\nIs it alright if I don't use Travis Cl at all?

The point of this is that you can often discover very quickly if your commit broke something, and fix it before it becomes a problem. I would recommend running Travis CI on every GitHub repo that you have unit tests in and is using a programming language supported by Travis CI. Since setting up Travis CI is very easy, I don't normally see a good reason not to use it, unless you don't care if you have passing tests in your program or not.

I wanted to retain the /etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml settings that I had painstakingly hand-written.\nLuckily I backed up config.toml, because sudo gitlab-runner unregister -t ... -u ... deleted the whole configuration from config.toml.\nIn order to get the same config registered under the group instead of the project, I had to:\n\nRegister the runner in a paused state with a dummy configuration, with the group's registration token:\n\nsudo gitlab-runner register \\\n  --non-interactive \\\n  --url <URL HERE>\n  --registration-token <TOKEN HERE> \\\n  --executor docker \\\n  --docker-image docker:dind \\\n  --paused\n\n\nGo into the new config.toml that this created and copy the runner's individual runner token.\n\nOverwrite config.toml with my desired configuration.\n\nEdit the config.toml and plug in the new individual runner token.\n\nStart the Gitlab runner service (sudo systemctl start gitlab-runner).\n\nUnpause the runner in the Gitlab web UI.\n\n\nEven after doing all this, the Gitlab instance still sees the runner under the name it registered with in the dummy config, rather than the name in the config.toml.\nTrying the --config option to gitlab-runner register didn't work at all; I think that just tells it where to save the config. It still prompted me for new settings to use instead of reading from the config.toml I pointed it at.\nThe Gitlab documentation on runner registration is all written around one shot gitlab-runner register commands with loads of options on them that essentially specify the whole config on the command line. I really don't want to translate my config.toml manually into a command line that turns around and rebuilds it (minus any comments, of course).\nI can't believe that this is really the right workflow to re-register a runner with a new project/group/Gitlab instance, or to create a copy of a runner from a saved config.

Then name is only created when you register the runner. I read something somewhere that you can change the tags of a shared runner, but I can't find it now.\nHere is a workaround to make the process of registering a bit more automatic:\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/3553#note_108527430\nHe used this API:\ncurl --request POST \"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/runners\" --form \"token=<registration-token>\" --form \"description=test-1-20150125-test\" --form \"tag_list=ruby,mysql,tag1,tag2\"\n\nThen he got the following response back:\n{\"id\":401513,\"token\":\"<runner-token>\"}\n\nHe could then inject the runner-token into his already pre-made .toml file.\nFor you, it would have been possible to use the registration token for your group, and then to write in the description/name of the runner and the tags.
