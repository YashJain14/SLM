The\nkey is to reorder your commits first (git rebase -i), so they are\nin the order you want to push them.\n$commit doesn't have to be a sha1. For example,\n\"HEAD~N\" would push everything before the last N commits.\n$branch (typically \"master\" or \"main\") is the branch you push to – the remote branch. It does not have to be the same as a local branch.\nIf you need to get some commits out of the way locally, you can use the cherry-pick method (suggested by midtiby) to move them onto a separate local branch first. But as shown here, it's not necessary to create a local branch for the purpose of pushing to a remote branch.  You can work on multiple branches at once if you are careful about which commits you push where.\n\n\nIf the remote branch does not exist yet, and you want to create it, it must be prefixed with refs/heads/ (to disambiguate branch from tag):\ngit push origin $commit:refs/heads/$branch\n\nAnd as a variation of this theme, deleting a remote branch can be thought of as pushing no commit to it:\ngit push origin :$branch\n\n\nPro tip: git-revise is a tool for massaging your commit stack into shape before pushing. It has a similar interface to git rebase. This tool is irreplaceable (correct me if I'm wrong) for sufficiently hard commit untangling jobs, though its interface is in dire need of replacement."}]}

Or, rather, why is this nomenclature being used as the commit message?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This scenario is not unusual.\nThe key here is that the branches being merged are different: it's the remote repository's develop branch being merged into the developer's local (working) develop branch.\nIn the developer's local repository there are two distinct branches:\n\ndevelop = The branch he/she is currently working on. The new commits go here.\norigin/develop = This is essentially a snapshot that the current repository holds about the state of the develop branch on the remote server. It gets updated with the remote changes when you do fetch or pull, and with the local changes after a successful push.\n\nNow, when you do git pull, two things happen. This is because git pull is essentially an alias for other two git operations: fetch and merge:\n\nfetch - brings all new commits (if any) from the remote repository to the local origin/develop branch.\nmerge - takes the new commits and applies them to the local working develop branch. This can happen in one of two ways:\n\n\nif the local working branch does not contain divergent history (new commits that the remote does not know about), then it simply advances the develop branch pointer ahead, so that it points to the latest commit in origin/develop. This is known as a fast-forward merge.\nif the developer has some new commits of his own that are not present in the remote repo, and, therefore not in the origin/develop branch, then a regular merge is done, meaning that there's a new commit, containing the changes from both branches. By default, git assigns messages like these to such commits: Merge branch 'develop' of https://bitbucket.org/abc/xyz into develop.\n\n\nSo, the scenario is a pretty common one.\nNow, if this happens very often and you don't like to see very complex commit history graphs containing commits like the one we're talking about, try looking into using rebase instead of merge.\nYou can do this two ways (when getting the changes from the remote server):\n\ngit fetch; git rebase\ngit pull --rebase"}]}

The contents of the blob objects are uninterpreted sequences\nof bytes.  There is no encoding translation at the core\nlevel. Path names are encoded in UTF-8 normalization form C. This\napplies to tree objects, the index file, ref names, as well as\npath names in command line arguments, environment variables\nand config files ( .git/config (see git-config ), gitignore , gitattributes and gitmodules ). Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as\nsequences of non-NUL bytes, there are no path name encoding\nconversions (except on Mac and Windows). Therefore, using\nnon-ASCII path names will mostly work even on platforms and file\nsystems that use legacy extended ASCII encodings. However,\nrepositories created on such systems will not work properly on\nUTF-8-based systems (e.g. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice versa.\nAdditionally, many Git-based tools simply assume path names to\nbe UTF-8 and will fail to display other encodings correctly. Commit log messages are typically encoded in UTF-8, but other\nextended ASCII encodings are also supported. This includes\nISO-8859-x, CP125x and many others, but not UTF-16/32,\nEBCDIC and CJK multi-byte encodings (GBK, Shift-JIS, Big5,\nEUC-x, CP9xx etc.). Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded\nin UTF-8, both the core and Git Porcelain are designed not to\nforce UTF-8 on projects.  If all participants of a particular\nproject find it more convenient to use legacy encodings, Git\ndoes not forbid it.  However, there are a few things to keep in\nmind. git commit and git commit-tree issue\na warning if the commit log message given to it does not look\nlike a valid UTF-8 string, unless you explicitly say your\nproject uses a legacy encoding.  The way to say this is to\nhave i18n.commitEncoding in .git/config file, like this: [i18n]\n\tcommitEncoding = ISO-8859-1 Commit objects created with the above setting record the value\nof i18n.commitEncoding in their encoding header.  This is to\nhelp other people who look at them later.  Lack of this header\nimplies that the commit log message is encoded in UTF-8. git log , git show , git blame and friends look at the encoding header of a commit object, and try to re-code the\nlog message into UTF-8 unless otherwise specified.  You can\nspecify the desired output encoding with i18n.logOutputEncoding in .git/config file, like this: [i18n]\n\tlogOutputEncoding = ISO-8859-1 If you do not have this configuration variable, the value of i18n.commitEncoding is used instead. Note that we deliberately chose not to re-code the commit log\nmessage when a commit is made to force UTF-8 at the commit\nobject level, because re-coding to UTF-8 is not necessarily a\nreversible operation."}]}

Or how content hosting works.\nFirst of all, your repo is not on GitHub nor GitLab. Your repo is on your hard disk, right there where you cloned or created it. This is a repository. Local one. This is where you do the work *)\nOn GitHub and on GitLab you can setup remote copy of your repository. Then, after you did some work on your local repo, you can instruct your local repo to send those new bits of work to that remote copy. Or to another remote copy. Or to 50 remote copies held in different places.\nSecond fact is, GitHub and GitLab are separate. In fact, there is one GitHub, but there is no single GitLab. There are many GitLabs out there, you can even buy a server and host your own GitLab. This only emphasises that they are all separate. Whatever you send to GitHub will NOT magically show up on GitLab1, nor GitLab2, nor (..)\nThird fact, they are all separate, but they all allow you to host copies of your git repo. Since you can instruct your local repo to send things to multiple remotes, you can have them all in sync.\nHowever, pasting all the URLs to all servers each time you want to do a push would be cumbersome, so your local git repo can be taught to know the remote locations and remember them for you. This called remotes and you probably saw it already in form:\ngit push origin master\n          \\        \\\n           \\        branch to be pushed\n            name of the remote\n\norigin is the typical name for the-single-remote-server you work with. But if you want to have many, you probably want to set some meaningful names, like:\ngit remote add remote-github (url-to-repo-on-github)\ngit remote add remote-gitlab1 (url-to-repo-on-gitlab1)\ngit remote add remote-gitlab2 (url-to-repo-on-gitlab2)\n...\n\nThis sets up 3+ remotes with different names. Now you can:\ngit push remote-github master\ngit push remote-gitlab1 master\n\nand so on. That will work - basically, do code changes, commit, push them to 3+ servers, and you have \"same things on GitHub and GitLab\". Keep in mind that if you are not alone and if you let someone work on your code on GitHub/GitLab separately, everyone would need to push to all remotes at the same time and in the same order, or else it can diverge quickly.\nManually pushing to 2+ remotes can be somewhat cumbersome too, even if they are remembered by their names. That's why recent Git versions allow to set multiple push URLs under single name of a remote.\nAlso, Git repositories, and some Git hostings, support \"triggers\" or \"hooks\". These things allow you to set a script that will be executed every time something happens. Something like a commit or push. Using that you could instruct your hosting to, for example, at every received push do a push to the other remote repo. But I won't cover it, here&now, I think you already have enough keywords to search for!\n*) well, except for some semi-automated things like PRs/MRs/Reviews/Issues/etc - but that's specific to your workflow and support for it on the hosting site. Obviously, since sites are separate, and since support for features may differ, PRs/MRs/Reviews/../etc performed on one site will not magically transfer to other sites. If the specific feature is implemented via branches, then you can sync that via some hooks&scripting. Otherwise, you'd need to find a proper plugin for the site. Or, well, write it yourself.

Is it recommended do this?\nPlease don't mark a duplicate with this other question: Are there any downsides to enabling git rerere?. Because my doubt isn't related to \"So is there any downside to enabling rerere?. What potential problems can it cause that would not otherwise occur?\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What is git rerere?\nAs the documentation notes, rerere stands for reuse recorded resolution.\nThat doesn't really explain what it is, though.  It's worth adding first, here, that git rerere itself—the command—is not something you have to run.  It has just six subcommands: clear, forget, diff, status, remaining, and gc.  None of these record or reuse a resolution—in fact, git rerere clear and git rerere forget <path> just discard some recorded resolutions.  The gc command is similar, but refers to ones that are old, rather than current ones.\nMost of the work happens from the setting of rerere.enabled (which makes Git run git rerere, with no subcommand, for you, at the appropriate times).  You can run git rerere with no subcommands yourself, but this doesn't really do anything important since Git will do that on its own.\ngit config rerere.enabled true\nOnce you have set rerere.enabled, when Git does a merge—any merge, including those from git am and git rebase and git cherry-pick and so on, not just those from git merge itself—and hits a conflict, Git will:\n\nrecord (once the merge-as-a-verb hits them) the conflicting diff hunks;\nwait for you to resolve them manually;\nrecord (at git commit time) what you did to resolve them.\n\nThere's a step missing here, which is why this is numbered starting at 2.  Step 1 is:\n\ncheck for previous recorded resolutions for these conflicts: if they exist, use them to resolve those conflicts automatically.\n\nIf the recorded resolutions completely resolve the conflicts, steps 2-4 become redundant.  Git may still run them all (I'm not sure that it does) to update the timestamps on the recorded resolutions.\nSummary\nOnce you set rerere.enabled, it's the act of merging itself that both creates the conflicts and (because it automatically runs git rerere with no arguments) records them and then tries to re-use any existing recorded resolutions.  It's the act of committing itself that records the final resolutions (because Git automatically runs git rerere again for you).  So it is all automatic—you just need to make sure, by running your own git diff commands, that your previous re-used resolutions are correct.  If not, just fix them files, add, and commit as usual, and Git will replace the recorded resolutions with the new ones.\nNote that you must still git add and git commit!  You should always inspect the merge results (and/or run tests)—though you should do this always, regardless of your rerere.enabled setting.\nAs VonC points out in a comment, if you have existing merge conflict resolutions you did not record earlier, you can \"train\" the rerere database on those resolutions.  There is a contributed script in the Git source to do this; it's also available on-line."}]}

The docker instance that's loaded up is like a (very) lightweight virtual machine. Docker configures a virtual network interface which you'll see if you run ifconfig from your host machine:\nuser@pc:~> ifconfig\ndocker0   Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr XXXX\n          inet addr:172.17.0.1  Bcast:0.0.0.0  Mask:255.255.0.0\n          ...\n\nThis is the IP address of the host machine on that interface.

Just don't send it to localhost or 127.0.0.1 because, to the runner, that points to its \"VM\", not your GitLab instance."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are pull requests part of Git, or a feature of tools like GitHub, Gerrit and Atlassian Stash?\n\nPull requests seem to be the common way to do code review with Git. However, it is not clear whether this term means the same when using the built-in git request-pull, or a different tool.\nAre pull requests an intrinsic function of Git, or is it a common term for tools like GitHub, Gerrit or Atlassian Stash?\nIs the discussion and \"result\" of the code review stored in the Git commit history or in a separate database?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pull requests are a simple concept that originated when Git was created but has been taken to different levels since.\nThe essence is that you do not have push rights to the repository you want to contribute on, so instead you fork the repository, making your private copy (a clone already does this btw.) and you contribute to that one instead. And then you ask a maintainer of the original repository to pull in your changes. So you are essentially submitting a patch.\nNow as I said, there are different ways to do this, but it all boils down to requesting a maintainer to pull in your changes, hence the name. The original purpose Git was created for is the Linux kernel, and they have been developing using mailing lists forever. So for them, a pull request is actually sending a patch per email; those patches are actually commit objects prepended by some normal email communication stuff—Git has tools to generate this.\ngit request-pull is a similar tool to generate a message asking for a pull request. But in this case, it’s closer to the pull idea. While patches can just be applied, requests created by request-pull actually tell the maintainer to pull the changes from a different remote repository.\nThe Git book has this example:\n$ git request-pull origin/master myfork\nThe following changes since commit 1edee6b1d61823a2de3b09c160d7080b8d1b3a40:\n  John Smith (1):\n        added a new function\n\nare available in the git repository at:\n\n  git://githost/simplegit.git featureA\n\nJessica Smith (2):\n      add limit to log function\n      change log output to 30 from 25\n\n lib/simplegit.rb |   10 +++++++++-\n 1 files changed, 9 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)\n\nSo it’s really just a utility to generate messages to execute the underlying concept.\nOther source code hosters like GitHub do this similarly as well. When you create a pull request on GitHub, you just create an issue which contains further information where the commits are the maintainer can pull. Of course, it all being on a single website, they can interlink everything a bit more and provide those one-click merge buttons for example.\nBut the basic concept is still the same: Requesting a maintainer to pull in some changes you have made. The only difference is the way this request is communicated with."}]}

In the future, there will be some iOS development. I'm very familiar with SVN, VSS and TFVC for source control. However, I have never used Git. I prefer TFS for process management/agile development... It's not perfect, but it integrates well into Visual Studio.\nSo, to help me decide between these two systems...\nWhat are the big differences between TFVC and Git for source control when using Visual Studio 2013?\n\nIs the only benefit in my case a local repository (not saying that it's insignificant) and iOS development support?\nIs the only drawback to Git the command line interface (some would argue that's not a drawback ;-P).\nHave you experienced in the Visual Studio 2013 GUI for Git?

Windows and Office sources now live in Git in Azure DevOps.\nMicrosoft has bought GitHub which is now the main focus for DevOps related offerings, many people who contributed to Azure DevOps have moved to GitHub as a consequence.\nVirtual File System for Git & Git Large File System have resolved many of the reasons why people stayed on TFVC.\nAzure DevOps has a built-in migration tool which can convert (part of) your TFVC history into a git repo.\n\nIn all this time very little happened for TFVC:\n\nYAML pipelines have yet to receive TFVC support 2 years after their introduction (I'm not expecting these at all).\nTeam Explorer is now called \"Legacy\" in Visual Studio\nTFVC has been declared feature complete\nTFVC support for Eclipse and Visual Studio Code and Linux/Mac are officially deprecated/end-of-life.\n\nIt's pretty clear who has won: Git.\n\n\nWhat are the big differences between TFS and Git for source control when using VS 2013?\n\nMSDN has a very extensive page on all the features and differences between Team Foundation Version Control and Git.\n\nIs the only benefit in my case a local repository (not saying that's insignificant) and IoS development support?\n\nNo, there's lot more, but they're often advanced scenario's of Git. Local Repo, offline support and full local  fidelity on history is incredibly powerful, you get that out of the box with Visual Studio. There's a few other features that are great too! The ability to branch and merge from one repository to another is very powerful. I recommend you look up the Pro Git book for those. Git in TFS is just another git server, it  has pretty much all features that the standard Git has.\nThe ability to rewrite history before merging allows you to remove or combine a number of smaller change sets, so that the history is cleaner and easier to read as a human.\n\nIs the only drawback to Git the command line interface (some would argue that's not a drawback ;-P).\n\nTFVC has a command line too, people just don't use it. For people that want to use Git and never do much more than TFVC does, they probably won't really need to leave the UI, they won't get a lot of the cool features though...\nThere might be a few other drawbacks, mostly due to the fact that it's different than what people are used to. It's not too hard to shoot yourself in the foot if you don't take the time to learn what git does when you do things. Things like Rebase and Squash are really powerful and create a very clean history, but it can leave people with the problem that they can't merge anymore if used incorrectly. TFS has the ability to put some security settings to take away the rights to make very stupid decisions on a git repository.\nA very cool add-on for Git users on Windows is PoSHGit. it provides command autocompletion on the Powershell commandline.\n\nHave you experienced in the VS 2013 GUI for Git? Is that enough to support basic branching/merging without the command line interface?\n\nIt has all you need for  basic operations. But you do need to be able to visualize the different branches to know what's going on. Since the Git server and local repo are just Git, any git  client can help you out here. SourceTree is an option here. The Git for Windows client is another.\nFor standard operations, check-in, check-out, merge, branch (or push, pull, fetch, commit, merge) the UI works just fine.\n\nIs there a detailed start-up guide for Git that shows Git being used with VS 2013?

Branching in Git is literally branching.  Here's what a repository looks like if feature branched off master when master was a commit B.\nA - B - C - F - H [master]\n     \\\n      D - E - G - I[feature]\n\nSee?  Actual branch.  When you git merge feature into master, you get this.\nA - B - C - F - H - J [master]\n     \\             /\n      D - E - G - I  [feature]\n\nAnd once you git branch -d feature the branch history remains!\nA - B - C - F - H - J [master]\n     \\             /\n      D - E - G - I\n\nJ has the parents H and I.  J cannot exist without them, it's baked into how Git works.  I cannot exist without G.  G cannot exist without E.  And so on.  The branch must remain\nJ is a merge commit which will typically contain the name of the branch being merged.  Its like any other commit, so you can even add more information to it, like a link back to your issue tracker.\ngit merge --no-ff is used to prevent Git from doing a \"fast forward\" and losing the branch history.  This happens if no work has been done on master since the branch was created.  A fast-forward looks like this.\nA - B[master]- D - E - G - I [feature]\n\ngit checkout master\ngit merge feature\n\nA - B - D - E - G - I [feature] [master]\n\nSince master is a direct ancestor of feature, no merge is required.  Git can just move the master label.  Your branch history is lost, it looks like D, E, G and I were all done as individual commits on master.  git merge --no-ff tells Git to never do this, to always perform a merge.\nIn the future, when it's noticed a bug was introduced in G, anyone browsing the repository can see it was done as part of the branch, look ahead to find the merge commit, and get information about the branch from there.\nEven so, why delete the branch?  Two reasons.  First, it will clutter up your list of branches with dead branches.\nSecond, and more important, it prevents you from reusing the branch.  Branching and merging are complicated.  Single use, short lived feature branches simplify the process by ensuring you only ever merge the branch back into master once.  This eliminates many technical and management problems.  When you merge a branch, it is done.  If you need to fix a problem introduced in that branch, just treat it as a bug in master and make a new branch to fix it.\nUnfortunately, git log lies to the user and presents a linear representation of history that is not linear.  To fix this, use git log --graph --decorate.  This will draw lines as in my examples above, and show you any branches and tags on each commit.  You'll get a much truer view of the repository.\nIf you're on a Mac, GitX will visualize the repository for you.  gitk is the generic version."}]}

I know that github offers ssh/ssl support and am familiar but could someone give me a breakdown of what sort of internal security they would use to make sure my committed conf/credential files don't get hacked?\nEDIT: I've read http://help.github.com/security/ but I would like an answer from someone who has worked with multiple repository hosts and has real-world experience with this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We tried out github recently.\nCompared with our previous git hosting (which was on our own linux virtual server), I'm not overly impressed with the security. We did decide to use it, but only for projects where keeping the code private wasn't a huge concern.\nNamely:\n\nThere's no company control at all over the user accounts. We control which users have access to our repository, but there's no password policies, the users pick their own email addresses, etc.\nThere's no way to limit access by IP address\nPasswords can only be reset by the user\nCompromising the users email account (which we're unable to see what account they've set it to) also results in a compromise of their github account, as they use an email challenge to reset forgotten passwords.\nThere's no access logs (there is an audit trail for most or possibly all changes, but no logging at all for access)\nAccess to the web front end is only password protected, so is vulnerable to password reuse from other sites and to some extent to brute forcing (github's statement about what they do for failed logins is pretty unclear).\n\nOne or two of these we could live, but in combination they basically make github completely unsuitable.\nThey have added 2 factor authentication recently, and there is an API so that organisations can at least check if users with access to their repositories have two factor authentication enabled. Whilst I don't feel this is really the best solution, it probably just about moves github into being secure enough that it can be considered for private repos.\nAs mt3 notes, you can run an enterprise install instead, which presumably significantly improves security - but the cost difference between that and a standard github company account is staggering, and it would probably mean you miss out on all the third party tools that integrate with github.\nOn a non-security note, they do at least now support annual billing properly, which helps reduce the paperwork overhead.\nGitHub have recently announced new business plans with extra features - this could solve '1'/'4'/'5'. (Though the 'uptime guarantee' that's part of it is pretty laughable - not even \"four 9s\", and excludes scheduled maintenance and anything they deem 'outside their reasonable control' - and it's not an actual guarantee, it's just a small credit against your next bill which is capped to be no more than a third of your bill. Basically very carefully worded marketing weasel words instead of any kind of commitment from them.)"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Git branching strategy integated with testing/QA process\nOur development team has been using the GitFlow branching strategy and it has been great !\nRecently we recruited a couple testers to improve our software quality. The idea is that every feature should be tested/QA by a tester.\nIn the past, developers work on features on separate feature branches and merge them back to the develop branch when done. The developer will test his work himself on that feature branch. Now with testers, we start asking this Question\n\nOn which branch should the tester test   new features ?\n\nObviously, there are two options: \n\non the individual feature branch\non the develop branch\n\nTesting On Develop Branch\nInitially, we believed this is the sure way to go because:\n\nThe feature is tested with all other features merged to the develop branch since it's development started. \nAny conflicts can be detected earlier than later\nIt makes the tester's job easy, he is only dealing with one branch (develop) at all time. He doesn't need to ask the developer about which branch is for which feature ( feature branches are personal branches managed exclusively and freely by relevant developers )\n\nThe biggest problems with this is:\n\nThe develop branch is polluted with bugs. \nWhen the tester finds bugs or conflicts, he reports them back to the developer, who fixes the issue on the develop branch (the feature branch were abandoned once merged ), and there could be more fixes required afterward. Multiple subsequence commits or merges (if a branch is recreated off develop branch again for fixing the bugs) makes rolling back the feature from the develop branch very difficult if possible. There are multiple features merging to and being fixed on the develop branch at different times. This creates a big issue when we want to create a release with just some of the features in the develop branch \n\nTesting On Feature Branch\nSo we thought again and decided we should test features on the feature branches. Before we test, we merge the changes from the develop branch to the feature branch ( catch up with the develop branch ). This is good:\n\nYou still test the feature with other features in the mainstream\nFurther development ( e.g. bug fix, resolving conflict ) will not pollute the develop branch;\nYou can easily decide not to release the feature until it is fully tested and approved;\n\nHowever, there are some drawbacks\n\nThe tester has to do the merging of the code, and if there's any conflict (very likely), he has to ask the developer for help. Our testers specialize in test and are not capable of coding.\na feature could be tested without the existence of another new feature. e.g. Feature A and B are both under test at the same time, the two features are unaware of each other because neither of them has been merged to the develop branch. These means you will have to test against the develop branch again when both of the features are merged to the develop branch anyway. And you have to remember to test this in the future.\nIf Feature A and B are both tested and approved, but when merged a conflict is identified, both of the developers for both features believe it is not his own fault/job because his feature branch past the test. There is an extra overhead in communication, and sometimes whoever resolving the conflict is frustrated. \n\n\nAbove is our story. With limited resource, I would like to avoid testing everything everywhere. We are still looking for a better way to cope with this. I would love to hear how other teams handle this kind of situations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The way we do it is the following:\nWe test on the feature branches after we merge the latest develop branch code on them. The main reason is that we do not want to \"pollute\" the develop branch code before a feature is accepted. In case a feature would not be accepted after testing but we would like to release other features already merged on develop that would be hell. Develop is a branch from which a release is made and thus should better be in a releasable state. The long version is that we test in many phases. More analytically:\n\nDeveloper creates a feature branch for every new feature.\nThe feature branch is (automatically) deployed on our TEST environment with every commit for the developer to test.\nWhen the developer is done with the implementation and the feature is ready to be tested they reabse the develop branch on the feature branch and deploy the feature branch that contains all the latest develop changes on TEST.\nThe tester tests on TEST. When they are done they \"accept\" the story and merge the feature branch on develop. Since the developer had previously rebased the develop branch on the feature one we don't expect too many conflicts. However, if that's the case the developer can help. This is a tricky step, I think the best way to avoid it is to keep features as small/specific as possible. Different features have to be eventually merged, one way or another. Of course the size of the team plays a role on this step's complexity.\nThe develop branch is also (automatically) deployed on TEST. We have a policy that even though the features branch builds can fail the develop branch should never fail.\nOnce we have reached a feature freeze we create a release from develop. This is automatically deployed on STAGING. Extensive end to end tests take place on there before the production deployment. (ok maybe I exaggerate a bit they are not very extensive but I think they should be). Ideally beta testers/colleagues i.e. real users should test there.\n\nWhat do you think of this approach?"}]}

However, it's still of general interest, IMO.)\nMy C# Protocol Buffers Port uses github for its source control, and I'm beginning to really enjoy using git. However, as far as I can tell, github doesn't provide any project management tools: defect and feature tracking, discussions, feature requests, docs etc. Given my affiliations, Google Code would be a natural choice, but it would seem odd to create a project there but host the source on github.\nThis question about Fogbugz/Assembla seems to mostly focus on the defect tracking. I was wondering what experiences others have had when it comes to a more \"complete\" project management solution. Does Fogbugz actually do everything I need? (Using a wiki for docs has its advantages, although I also want to be able to distribute documentation with the code.) Beyond the explicit features mentioned in the first paragraph, are there other project aspects I should be considering which I may have missed?\nThis will definitely stay an open source project, and although I'd rather not pay I don't mind if a small fee is required. Currently I'm the only developer, but that may change and there may very well be lots of people filing bugs and feature requests. (In other words, I  hope and expect it to be popular, but with me doing most of the work.)\nPreviously I've contributed to various open source projects, but haven't done much in the way of running a very visible and active one. (MiscUtil is currently still \"hosted\" on my website, with occasional releases - the actual source control is on my local NAS.)\nAnyone care to share their experiences?\nEDIT: Another option I'm now considering is a Google Code project (I really would like to be loyal to my employer) and an occasional merge from git to svn (at the very least, every time I do a release). This would allow non-git users to get hold of the source easily too."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you're thinking that you'll really be the only developer, Fogbugz will help you keep your sanity. Fogbugz is a great product, It builds focused communications and can turn anything into a case (issue).

(About the only criticism I can think of is it doesn't do  case blocking and dependency tracking, which is really useful for those bugs buried deep.)  \nLittle of this feature set will help you build an active open source project, with open lively communication and the need build a community and have users evolve into developers as the project grows. So if that's where you want to end up, you may really want the less focused communication channels of one of these lightweight tracking systems. \nI haven't used Google Code on a project yet, but in terms of transparent & open  communication, it looks like a good support for an active open source project.  Plus you already know it. If you want to grow the involvement in your project, Google code looks like the way to go."}]}

You have to execute in a notebook this lines (this outputs an URL you have to go to give OAuth2 access to your Google Drive to the Colab instance).In a cell just run:\nfrom google.colab import drive \ndrive.mount(/content/myfiles)\n\n\nThis mounts on the container File System the root folder of your Google Drive in /content/myfiles/MyDrive\n\n\nOnce mounted change directory executing a magic command with %cd (with !cd will not work, each shell command is executed in a temporary subshell so it is not persistent)\n%cd \"/content/myfiles/MyDrive/Folder1/Folder2\"\n!pwd\n\n\nOnce there you initialize the git repository (this is just the first time, due to the fact that all this is done in your Google Drive means that it is a repository that will persist between sessions, if not once you leave the Google Colab session it would be removed).\n !git init\n\n\nThis creates the .git folder within your Google Drive folder\n\n\nNow you have to configure typical git parameters locally (so it is stored on the .git folder) needed when pushing/pulling (again this has to be done just the first time):\n!git config --local user.email your_gitlab_mail@your_domain.com \n!git config --local user.name your_gitlab_name\n\n\nNow add the remote using the PAT created before (again this is done just the first time):\n\nKey Point: The remote URL format (it has to be over HTTPs) depends on weather the Gitlab project (repo) is under a group/subgroups or not:\n\nUnder a group (there could be /group/subgroup1/subgroup2/.../project.git or just /group/projec.git)\n!git remote add origin https://<pat_name>:pat_code>@gitlab.com/group_name/subgroup1/project_name.git\n\n\nNOT Under a group\n!git remote add origin https://<pat_name>:pat_code>@gitlab.com/your_gitlab_username/project_name.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the git repository is configured within the Google Drive Folder  not just in the File System Container so you can pull/push besides all the usual git commands\n!git add .\n!git commit -m\"First commit\"\n!git push -u origin master\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter this is done the first time now in order to keep \"version controlling\" with Git and GitLab (again I guess it is very similar with GitHub for the Groups feature of GitLab for me is quite valuable) the files in the MyDrive/Folder1/Folder2 you should create a notebook that mounts the Google Drive and the git commands you want while you edit the other files in the folder.\nI would say the best way is to have a parametrized notebook that checks if this is the first time to do the git initialization and so on and if not to just add/commit/push to the GitLab repository.\nCloning\nFor just cloning into the Container FS (or into Google Drive if it is already mounted) it is just use the same remote explained above with git clone:\n\nUnder a group\n  !git clone https://<pat_name>:<pat_code>@gitlab.com/group_name/project_name.git\n\n\nNOT Under a group\n  !git clone https://<pat_name>:<pat_code>@gitlab.com/gitlab_user_name/project_name.git\n\n\n\nEdit: I am adding the notebook I have created so you can use it to interact between Colab and GitLab called Gitlab_Colab_Interaction.ipynb so you can use it directly from Colab:\nImports\nimport os\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nParameters\n# Paths\ncontainer_folder_abspath = Path('/content/myfiles')\ngdrive_subfolder_relpath = Path('MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/PathTo/FolderYouWant') # No need to scape the space with pathlib Paths\ngitlab_project_relpath = Path('/group_name/subgroup1/YourProject.git')\n# Personal Access Token\nPAT_name = 'my_pat_name'\nPAT_code = 'XXXX_PAT_CODE_XXXXX'\n\nMount Drive\nfrom google.colab import drive\ndrive.mount(str(container_folder_abspath))\n\n\nfullpath = container_folder_abspath / gdrive_subfolder_relpath # Path objects with the operator /\n%cd $fullpath\n!pwd\n\nInitialization (or not)\ninitialization = True\nfor element in fullpath.iterdir():\n    if element.is_dir():\n        if element.name == '.git':\n            initialization = False\n            print('Folder already initialized as a git repository!')\n    \n\ngitlab_url = 'https://' + PAT_name + ':' + PAT_code + '@gitlab.com/' + str(gitlab_project_relpath)\nif initialization:\n    !git init\n    !git config --local user.email [email protected]\n    !git config --local user.name your_gitlab_user\n    !git remote add origin $gitlab_url # Check that PATs are still valid\n    !echo \"GitLab_Colab_Interaction.ipynb\" >> \".gitignore\" # To ignore this file itself if it is included in the folder\n\nelse:\n    print(\"### Current Status ###\")\n    !git status\n    print(\"\\n\\n### Git log ###\")\n    !git log\n\nGit Commands\n# Git Add\n!git add *.ipynb # For example to add just the modified notebooks\n\n# Git Commit\n!git commit -m \"My commit message\"\n\n# Git Push\n!git push -u origin master # As of now Gitlab keeps using the name master"}]}

Reposurgeon has been used to convert several large projects to Git, including Emacs whose repository, ESR says, “is large, complex in branch structure, and old enough to have begun life as a CVS repo.  That last part matters because some of the ugliest translation problems lurking in the back history of Subversion projects are strange Subversion operation sequences (including combinations of branch copy operations) generated by cvs2svn.”\n(The git-svn tool included with Git will handle many Subversion repositories, including branches.  It’s pretty commonly used, especially by teams that are in the process of doing a conversion, since it allows Git to behave as a Subversion client.  But see ESR’s Don’t do svn-to-git repository conversions with git-svn!, where he discusses the drawbacks to git-svn as a conversion tool.)\nRegarding your second question, it isn’t branching where the power of Git is so helpful (though Git is at least as powerful as Subversion in this regard); it’s when it comes to merging those branches that Git shines.

Commit as often as is necessary. Do this because you will create valuable history. For instance you can try an approach to a problem and if it doesn't work, abandon it. If a day later you see the light and want to re-apply the solution, it is in your history!\nWhen the feature is fully developed and tested locally, checkout master.\ngit merge featureBranch\ngit push origin master\nTest the pushed changes on your development server. This is the moment to run every test you can think of.\nIf all is working out, merge the feature or fix into the stable branch. Now the change is live for your customers.\n\nGetting the code on the server\nThe updating of servers shouldn't be a problem. Basically I would set them up as users just like you're developers are. At my company we've setup the servers as read-only users. Basically that means the servers can never push anything but can always pull. Setting this up isn't trivial though, so you could just as well build a simple webinterface which simply only allows a git pull. If you can keep your developers from doing stuff on live implementations you're safe :)\n[EDIT]\nIn response to the last questions asked in the comments of this reaction:\nI don't know if I understand your question correctly, but basically (simplified a bit) this is how I would do this, were I in you shoes.\n\nThe testing machine (or the webroot which acts as testing implementation) has it source code based in a git repository with the master branch checked out. While creating this repository you could even remove all other references to all other branches so you'll be sure no can checkout a wrong branch in this repository. So basically the testing machine has a Git repository with only a master branch which is checked out.\nFor the live servers I would do exactly the same, but this time with the stable branch checked out. Developer should have a local repository cloned in which all branches exist. And a local implementation of the software you guys build. This software gets its source from a the local git repository. In other words: from the currently checked out branch in this repository.\nActual coding\nWhen a new feature is wanted, a local feature branch can be made based on the current master. When the branch is checked out the changes can be made and checked locally by the developer (since the software is now running on the source of the feature branch).\nIf everything seems to be in order, the changes get merged from feature branch to master and pushed to your \"git machine\". \"your github\" so to speak. Testing can now pull the changes in so every test necessary can be done by QA. If they decide everything is ok, the developer can merge the changes from master to stable and push again.\nAll thats left now is pulling form your live machines."}]}

But we thought we'd pick the hive-mind to find out what are best practices for git with idea.\nThe Idea UI is similar for both CVS and Git, yet the underlying implementations differ a bit.\nExample Questions\nFor example:\n-With CVS, when we had multiple release of a product, each of us would have a local copy of the 1-0, 2-0, 3-0, etc. branches , each with its own Intellij files (i.e. .ipr, .iws, etc.). The \"git way\" seems to have one project and use 'git branch' to switch branches.  This is fine, but it creates huge overhead for idea (as it has to reload each changed file, including checked-in jars) when you change branches. So: do you still have a separate project (with .git) for each \"major release\" or have one project and use \"git branch\"?\n-Is it a good idea to use Autostash?\n-Do you automatically add each modification to your git commit? or use \"git add\" later?\n-Do you rebase?\n-Best way to merge?\n-Any other hints/tips/what-works-for-you,etc.\nFinal Comments\nWe still \"think in cvs\"  so part of this is getting used to git; part is getting used to Idea's Ui for git. \nThese are fairly rudimentary questions as we still use the comand line primarily. Also I've heard idea 10 has better/stronger/faster git integration tools\nThanks"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's what we've found after several weeks of Git/Idea. I've made this a community wiki. Please throw in your 2 kronor/centimos/pfennings/cents. \nNote: I'm answering my own question because I sought those easy-use bullet points.\nPresupposition\nIdea is great tool. No one here is complaining. Just observing.\nBest Practices\n\nAt this point (9.0.3) Git with Idea is just plain harder to use than SVN with Idea. Part stems from the complexity of Git (vs SVN), partly because Idea's tools don't do everything in the git world.\nThus you will need to use the command line\nIdea's merge tool works much better than command line merging or even using mergetool (using meld or mergetool). The reason: you have much more freedeom to work in the 'idea environment' rather than fixe one lint  at a time.\nRemember to synchronize in Idea (ctrl-alt-y) when you update the working tree from the command line\nWatching the Git Console to learn idea's git tricks; idea executes git commands there.( Version Control view, Console tab):\n\nexample:\n13:30:58.234: git log -M --follow --name-only --pretty=format:%H%x00%ct%x00%an%x20%x3C%ae%x3E%x00%cn%x20%x3C%ce%x3E%x00%s%n%n%b%x00 --encoding=UTF-8 -- src/jsp/workspaces/include/edit.jsp\n13:31:02.437: cd J:\\projects\\PE-GIT\\pe\n13:31:02.437: git annotate -p -l -t -M HEAD -- src/jsp/workspaces/include/edit.jsp\n\n\nUnfortunately Idea does not have good tools for \"merging conflicts in upstream commits\" in 9.0.3\n\nExample:\n\nAlice does work, commits (locally)\nfile A, commits file B, commits file\nC  \nBob does work, commits file C, commits file D, commits file E  \nAlice pushes her changes  \nBob Pulls his changes\n\nComing from CVS/SVN, I expected Ideas handy diffing tool to pop up. No. Instead git/idea throw up a red flag,  I usually end up using \"git mergetool\" (meld od on linux, tortoiesmerge on windows).\nNote: Perhaps Idea provides a better way. Please set me straight.\nNote to the motivated: can you set up .gitconfig to use Idea's diffing tool?\nStashing\n\nIdeas \"Shelve\" functionality duplicates \"Git Stash\". Both seem similar.  Both use patches. You probably want to use one or the other. I haven't figured out the advantage of one or the other\n\nBig Old Projects\n\nIf you're working on a decade old project recently migrated to Git, with jar files checked into the scm (i.e. previously checked into CVS/SVN, where log4j-1.0.jar is in BRANCH-2-0 and the mainline has log4j-9.0.jar ), PROCEED WITH CAUTION if you want to checkout \"version 2.0\" of your project. Idea needs to unload all the \"head\" jars and reload the jars-checked-in-at-2.0. This takes for-ever. \n\nOther little stuff\n\nThe idea menus/UI still shows \"git init...\" even though you've already initialized Git. It's confusing, but ignore it.\nYou cannot have the same working tree in both Git and CVS/SVN (though the UI may seem to imply so). I/we tried this during an initial \"let's try git and still use CVS as a backup plan\" phase. It didn't work"}]}

I realized that I was confused by a number of things going on, some of which were exacerbated by IntelliJ IDEA (a tool I generally love, BTW). First, the 'fatal: pathspec' message from git rm is both unhelpful and misleading.\nSecond, I had the file in .gitignore, but had removed it before asking my question. However, it was also included in IDEA's Ignored Files feature independently of git, and showed as such in the project viewer (instead of untracked, as git status showed). Finally, I had IDEA running while I was experimenting, and it looks like it was recreating the file immediately after my rm.\nMy takeaway is that if I'm getting confusing Git behavior, make sure to quit IDEA and work solely in the command line (and gitk) while debugging."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your file .idea/workspace.xml is not under git version control.

I can see the submodules are currently at revision abc so when he at some point in the future get's back to this commit he probably wants the submodules at the same revision again.\"\nI can not see a single case where you would want the submodules to stay at the current revision while you go back 3 years in your main repository. However, there must be a reason for this implementation, right?\nI would really like to hear if any of you know the thoughts behind this, but in any case I would really like a solution. Is there a way to tell git: \"I want to commit this work with these submodules. If I at some point go back to this state I want the submodules to be checked out at the correct version as well.\"\nExample for clarification\nMy main repository is an application which needs to use SSL, and I find a SSL library (libSSL) I add as a submodule.\nOn Oct. 31 2010 I create a commit in my main repository (2fd4e1) while the submodule points to libSSL version 3 (c67a2d).\nTime passes, libSSl gets updated to version 34, I adapt my code, life it good.\nOn May 14 2013 I create a new commit (28fced) and submodule points to the most recent version of libSSL (849ee1).\nHowever, if I check out 2fd4e1 my submodule will stay at 849ee1 even though the original commit was created with c67a2d. Git knows I made the original commit with c67a2d and I don't see how you could possibly want a another submodule than the one the original commit was created with."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It sounds like what you want to do can be achieved from git v2.13 on with the new --recurse-submodules option of git checkout.

That's when I found Ansible. Great huh? Sure beats making bash scripts (louder scream) for everything I wanted to automate.\nWhat's the problem?\nI'm having a lot of trouble figuring out what user my Ansible playbook will run certain things as. I also need the ability to specify what user certain tasks will run as. Here are some specific use cases:\nCloning a repo as another user:\nMy purpose with this is it run my node.js webapp from another user, who we'll call bill (that can only use sudo to run a script that I made that starts the node server, as opposed to root or my user that can use sudo for all commands). To do this, I need the ability to have Ansible's git module clone my git repo as bill. How would I do that?\nKnowing how Ansible will gain root:\nAs far as I understand, you can set what user Ansible will connect to the server you're maintaining by defining 'user' and the beginning of the playbook file. Here's what I don't understand: if I tell it to connect via my username, joe, and ask it to update a package via the apt module, how will it gain root? Sudo usually prompts me for my password, and I'd prefer keeping it that way (for security).\nFinal request\nI've scoured the Ansible docs, done some (what I thought was thorough) Googling, and generally just tried to figure it out on my own, but this information continues to elude me.\nI am very new to Ansible, and while it's mostly straight-forwards, I would benefit greatly if I could understand exactly how Ansible runs, on which users it runs, and how/where I can specify what user to use at different times.\nThank you tons in advance"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You may find it useful to read the Hosts and Users section on Ansible's documentation site:\nhttp://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_intro.html#hosts-and-users\nIn summary, ansible will run all commands in a playbook as the user specified in the remote_user variable (assuming you're using ansible >= 1.4, user before that). You can specify this variable on a per-task basis as well, in case a task needs to run as a certain user.\nUse sudo: true in any playbook/task to use sudo to run it. Use the sudo_user variable to specify a user to sudo to if you don't want to use root.\nIn practice, I've found it easiest to run my playbook as a deploy user that has sudo privileges. I set up my SSH keys so I can SSH into any host as deploy without using a password. This means that I can run my playbook without using a password and even use sudo if I need to.\nI use this same user to do things like cloning git repos and starting/stopping services. If a service needs to run as a lower-privileged user, I let the init script take care of that. A quick Google search for a node.js init.d script revealed this one for CentOS:\nhttps://gist.github.com/nariyu/1211413\nDoing things this way helps to keep it simple, which I like.\nHope that helps."}]}

Thus that’s the default mode.\nThe non-cached version asks the question: show me the differences between HEAD and the currently checked out\ntree - index contents _and_ files that aren't up to date which is obviously a very useful question too, since that tells you what\nyou could commit. Again, the output matches the git diff-tree -r output to a tee, but with a twist. The twist is that if some file doesn’t match the index, we don’t have\na backing store thing for it, and we use the magic \"all-zero\" sha1 to\nshow that. So let’s say that you have edited kernel/sched.c , but\nhave not actually done a git update-index on it yet - there is no\n\"object\" associated with the new state, and you get: torvalds@ppc970:~/v2.6/linux> git diff-index --abbrev HEAD\n:100644 100644 7476bb5ba 000000000 M\tkernel/sched.c i.e., it shows that the tree has changed, and that kernel/sched.c is\nnot up to date and may contain new stuff. The all-zero sha1 means that to\nget the real diff, you need to look at the object in the working directory\ndirectly rather than do an object-to-object diff. Note As with other commands of this type, git diff-index does not\nactually look at the contents of the file at all. So maybe kernel/sched.c hasn’t actually changed, and it’s just that you\ntouched it. In either case, it’s a note that you need to git update-index it to make the index be in sync. Note You can have a mixture of files show up as \"has been updated\"\nand \"is still dirty in the working directory\" together. You can always\ntell which file is in which state, since the \"has been updated\" ones\nshow a valid sha1, and the \"not in sync with the index\" ones will\nalways have the special all-zero sha1."}]}

When you get there you do:\ngit init\n\nwhich initiates a new git repository in that directory.\nWhen you've done that, you need to register that new repo with a remote (where you'll upload -- push -- your files to), which in this case will be github. This assumes you have already created a github repository. You'll get the correct URL from your repo in GitHub.\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/[reponame].git\n\nYou need to add you existing files to your local commit:\ngit add .   # this adds all the files\n\nThen you need to make an initial commit, so you do:\ngit commit -a -m \"Initial commit\" # this stages your files locally for commit. \n                                  # they haven't actually been pushed yet\n\nNow you've created a commit in your local repo, but not in the remote one. To put it on the remote, you do the second line you posted:\ngit push -u origin --all"}]}

When installing a package from the project's github (during development for example) the lib/ dir will not exist, so if the package's package.json's main field points to (for example) lib/index.js, the package cannot be compiled when imported because these files do not exist within the repository and therefore within the package installed into node_modules. This means the package needs to built (just as it would be before release), only this time locally so that the lib directory (or whatever other files are generated during the build process) are added to the module's directory.\nAssuming there is a build script within the package.json file's scripts field, can the package be configured to run this automatically in the situation where it is installed from github only?

You should be able to do the git clean step at any point before or after the other two commands, but the git reset must come after the git fetch.\nLong\n\n[slightly reworded and formatted] Given a clone created with git clone --single-branch --depth 1 url directory, how can I update it to achieve the same result as rm -rf directory; git clone --single-branch --depth 1 url directory?\n\nNote that --single-branch is the default when using --depth 1.  The (single) branch is the one you give with -b.  There's a long aside that goes here about using -b with tags but I will leave that for later.  If you don't use -b, your Git asks the \"upstream\" Git—the Git at url—which branch it has checked-out, and pretends you used -b thatbranch.  This means that it is important to be careful when using --single-branch without -b to make sure that this upstream repository's current branch is sensible, and of course, when you do use -b, to make sure that the branch argument you give really does name a branch, not a tag.\nThe simple answer is basically this one, with two slight changes:\n\nAfter https://stackoverflow.com/a/20508591/279335, I tried git fetch --depth 1; git reset --hard origin/master, but two things: first I don't understand why git reset is needed, second, although the files seems to be up to date, some old files remains, and git clean -df does not delete these files.\n\nThe two slight changes are: make sure you use origin/branchname instead, and add -x (git clean -d -f -x or git clean -dfx) to the git clean step.  As for why, that gets a bit more complicated.\nWhat's going on\nWithout --depth 1, the git fetch step calls up the other Git and gets from it a list of branch names and corresponding commit hash IDs.  That is, it finds a list of all the upstream's branches and their current commits.  Then, because you have a --single-branch repository, your Git throws out all but the single branch, and brings over everything Git needs to connect that current commit back to the commit(s) you already have in your repository.\nWith --depth 1, your Git doesn't bother connecting the new commit to older historical commits at all.  Instead, it obtains just the one commit and the other Git objects needed to complete that one commit.  It then writes an additional \"shallow graft\" entry to mark that one commit as a new pseudo-root commit.\nRegular (non-shallow) clone and fetch\nThese are all related to how Git behaves when you're using a normal (non-shallow, non-single-branch) clone: git fetch calls up the upstream Git, gets a list of everything, and then brings over whatever you don't already have.  This is why an initial clone is so slow, and a fetch-to-update is usually so fast: once you get a full clone, the updates rarely have very much to bring over: maybe a few commits, maybe a few hundred, and most of those commits don't need much else either.\nThe history of a repository is formed from the commits.  Each commit names its parent commit (or for merges, parent commits, plural), in a chain that goes backwards from \"the latest commit\", to the previous commit, to some more-ancestral commit, and so on.  The chain eventually stops when it reaches a commit that has no parent, such as the first commit ever made in the repository.  This kind of commit is a root commit.\nThat is, we can draw a graph of commits.  In a really simple repository the graph is just a straight line, with all the arrows pointing backwards:\no <- o <- o <- o   <-- master\n\nThe name master points to the fourth and latest commit, which points back to the third, which points back to the second, which points back to the first.\nEach commit carries with it a complete snapshot of all the files that go in that commit.  Files that are not at all changed are shared across these commits: the fourth commit just \"borrows\" the unchanged version from the third commit, which \"borrows\" it from the second, and so on.  Hence, each commit names all the \"Git objects\" that it needs, and Git either finds those objects locally—because it already has them—or uses the fetch protocol to bring them over from the other, upstream Git.  There's a compression format called \"packing\", and a special variant for network transfer called \"thin packs\", that allows Git to do this even better / fancier, but the principle is simple: Git needs all, and only, those objects that go with the new commits it's picking up.  Your Git decides whether it has those objects, and if not, obtains them from their Git.\nA more-complicated, more-complete graph generally has several points where it branches, some where it merges, and multiple branch names pointing to different branch tips:\n        o--o   <-- feature/tall\n       /\no--o--o---o    <-- master\n    \\    /\n     o--o      <-- bug/short\n\nHere branch bug/short is merged back into master, while branch feature/tall is still undergoing development.  The name bug/short can (probably) now be deleted entirely: we don't need it anymore if we are done making commits on it.  The commit at the tip of master names two previous commits, including the commit at the tip of bug/short, so by fetching master we will fetch the bug/short commits.\nNote that both the simple and slightly-more-complicated graph each have just one root commit.  That's pretty typical: all repositories that have commits have at least one root commit, since the very first commit is always a root commit; but most repositories have only one root commit as well.  You can, however, have different root commits, as with this graph:\n o--o\n     \\\no--o--o   <-- master\n\nor this one:\n o--o     <-- orphan\n\no--o      <-- master\n\nIn fact, the one with just the one master was probably made by merging orphan into master, then deleting the name orphan.\nGrafts and replacements\nGit has for a long time had (possibly shaky) support for grafts, which was replaced with (much better, actually-solid) support for generic replacements.  To grasp them concretely we need to add, to the above, the notion that each commit has its own unique ID.  These IDs are the big ugly 40-character SHA-1 hashes, face0ff... and so on.  In fact, every Git object has a unique ID, though for graph purposes, all we care about are the commits.\nFor drawing graphs, those big hash IDs are too painful to use, so we can use one-letter names A through Z instead.  Let's use this graph again but put in one-letter names:\n        E--H   <-- feature/tall\n       /\nA--B--D---G    <-- master\n    \\    /\n     C--F      <-- bug/short\n\nCommit H refers back to commit E (E is H's parent).  Commit G, which is a merge commit—meaning it has at least two parents—refers back to both D and F, and so on.\nNote that the branch names, feature/tall, master, and bug/short, each point to one single commit.  The name bug/short points to commit F.  This is why commit F is on branch bug/short ... but so is commit C.  Commit C is on bug/short because it is reachable from the name.  The name gets us to F, and F gets us to C, so C is on branch bug/short.\nNote, however, that commit G, the tip of master, gets us to commit F.  This means that commit F is also on branch master.  This is a key concept in Git: commits may be on one, many, or even no branches.  A branch name is merely a way to get started within a commit graph.  There are other ways, such as tag names, refs/stash (which gets you to the current stash: each stash is actually a couple of commits), and the reflogs (which are normally hidden from view as they are normally just clutter).\nThis also, however, gets us to grafts and replacements.  A graft is just a limited kind of replacement, and shallow repositories use a limited form of graft.1  I won't describe replacements fully here as they are a bit more complicated, but in general, what Git does for all of these is to use the graft or replacement as an \"instead-of\".  For the specific case of commits, what we want here is to be able to change—or at least, pretend to change—the parent ID or IDs of any commit ... and for shallow repositories, we want to be able to pretend that the commit in question has no parents.\n\n1The way shallow repositories use the graft code is not shaky.  For the more general case, I recommended using git replace instead, as that also was and is not shaky.  The only recommended use for grafts is—or at least was, years ago—to put them in place just long enough to run git filter-branch to copy an altered—grafted—history, after which you should just discard the grafted history entirely.  You can use git replace for this purpose as well, but unlike grafts, you can use git replace permanently or semi-permanently, without needing git filter-branch.\n\nMaking a shallow clone\nTo make a depth-1 shallow clone of the current state of the upstream repository, we will pick one of the three branch names—feature/tall, master, or bug/short—and translate it to a commit ID.  Then we will write a special graft entry that says: \"When you see that commit, pretend that it has no parent commits, i.e., is a root commit.\"\nLet's say we pick master.  The name master points to commit G, so to make a shallow clone of commit G, we obtain commit G from the upstream Git as usual, but then write a special graft entry that claims commit G has no parents.  We put that into our repository, and now our graph looks like this:\nG   <-- master, origin/master\n\nThose parent IDs are still actually inside G; it's just that every time we have Git use or show us the history, it immediately \"grafts\" nothing-at-all on, so that G seems to be a root commit, for history tracking purposes.\nUpdating a shallow clone we made earlier\nBut what if we already have a (depth-1 shallow) clone, and we want to update it?  Well, that's not really a problem.  Let's say we made a shallow clone of the upstream back when master pointed to commit B, before the new branches and the bug fix.  That means we currently have this:\nB   <-- master, origin/master\n\nWhile B's real parent is A, we have a shallow-clone graft entry saying \"pretend B is a root commit\".  Now we git fetch --depth 1, which looks up the upstream's master—the thing we call origin/master—and sees commit G.  We grab commit G from the upstream, along with its objects, but deliberately don't grab commits D and F.  We then update our shallow-clone graft entries to say \"pretend G is a root commit too\":\nB   <-- master\n\nG   <-- origin/master\n\nOur repository now has two root commits:  The name master (still) points to commit B, whose parents we (still) pretend are non-existent, and the name origin/master points to G, whose parents we pretend are non-existent.\nThis is why you need git reset\nIn a normal repository, you might use git pull, which really is git fetch followed by git merge.  But git merge requires history, and we have none: we have faked Git out with pretend root commits, and they have no history behind them.  So we must use git reset instead.\nWhat git reset does is a bit complicated, because it can affect up to three different things: a branch name, the index, and the work-tree.  We have already seen what the branch names are: they simply point to a (one, specific) commit, which we call the tip of the branch.  That leaves the index and work-tree.\nThe work-tree is easy to explain: it's where all your files are.  That's it: no more and no less.  It's there so that you can actually use Git: Git is all about storing every commit ever made, forever, so that they can all be retrieved.  But they're in a format useless to mere mortals.  To be used, a file—or more typically, a whole commit's worth of files—has to be extracted into its normal format.  The work-tree is where that happens, and then you can work on it and make new commits using it too.\nThe index is a bit harder to explain.  It's something peculiar to Git: other version control systems don't have one, or if they have something like it, they don't expose it.  Git does.  Git's index is essentially where you keep the next commit to make, but that means that it starts out holding the current commit that you have extracted into the work-tree, and Git uses that to make Git fast.  We'll say more about this in a bit.\nWhat git reset --hard does is to affect all three: branch name, index, and work-tree.  It moves the branch name so that it points to a (probably different) commit.  Then it updates the index to match that commit, and updates the work-tree to match the new index.\nHence:\ngit reset --hard origin/master\n\ntells Git to look up origin/master.  Since we ran our git fetch, that now points to commit G.  Git then makes our master—our current (and only) branch—also point to commit G, and then updates our index and work-tree.  Our graph now looks like this:\nB   [abandoned - but see below]\n\nG   <-- master, origin/master\n\nNow master and origin/master both name commit G, and commit G is the one checked-out into the work-tree.\nWhy you need git clean -dfx\nThe answer here is a bit complicated, but usually it's \"you don't\" (need to git clean).\nWhen you do need git clean, it is because you—or something you ran—added files to your work-tree that you have not told Git about.  These are untracked and/or ignored files.  Using git clean -df will remove untracked files (and empty directories); adding -x will also remove the ignored files.\nFor more about the difference between \"untracked\" and \"ignored\", see this answer.\nWhy you don't need git clean: the index\nI mentioned above that you usually don't need to run git clean.  This is because of the index.  As I said earlier, Git's index is mainly \"the next commit to make\".  If you never add your own files—if you are just using git checkout to check out various existing commits that you have had all along, or that you have added with git fetch; or if you are using git reset --hard to move a branch name and also switch the index and work-tree to another commit—then whatever is in the index right now is there because an earlier git checkout (or git reset) put it in the index, and also into the work-tree.\nIn other words, the index has a short—and fast for Git to access—summary or manifest describing the current work-tree.  Git uses that to know what is in the work-tree now.  When you ask Git to switch to another commit, via git checkout or git reset --hard, Git can quickly compare the existing index to the new commit.  Any files that have changed, Git must extract from the new commit (and update the index).  Any files that are newly added, Git must also extract (and update the index).  Any files that are gone—that are in the existing index, but not in the new commit—Git must remove ... and that's what Git does.  Git updates, adds, and removes those files in the work-tree, as directed by the comparison between the current index, and the new commit.\nWhat this means is that if you do need git clean, you must have done something outside Git that added files.  These added files are not in the index, so by definition, they are untracked and/or ignored.  If they are merely untracked, git clean -f would remove them, but if they are ignored, only git clean -fx will remove them.  (You want -d just to remove directories that are or become empty during the cleaning.)\nAbandoned commits and garbage collection\nI mentioned, and drew in the updated shallow graph, that when we git fetch --depth 1 and then git reset --hard, we wind up abandoning the previous depth-1 shallow graph commit.  (In the graph I drew, this was commit B.)  However, in Git, abandoned commits are rarely truly abandoned—at least, not right away.  Instead, some special names like ORIG_HEAD hang on to them for a while, and each reference—branches and tags are forms of reference—carries with it a log of \"previous values\".\nYou can display each reflog with git reflog refname.  For instance, git reflog master shows you not only which commit master names now, but also which commits it has named in the past.  There is also a reflog for HEAD itself, which is what git reflog shows by default.\nReflog entries eventually expire.  Their exact duration varies, but by default they are eligible for expiration after 30 days in some cases and 90 days in others.  Once they do expire, those reflog entries no longer protect abandoned commits (or, for annotated tag references, the annotated tag object—tags are not supposed to move, so this case is not supposed to occur, but if it does—if you force Git to move a tag—it's just handled in the same way as all other references).\nOnce any Git object—commit, annotated tag, \"tree\", or \"blob\" (file)—is really unreferenced, Git is allowed to remove it for real.2  It's only at this point that the underlying repository data for the commits and files goes away.  Even then, it only happens when something runs git gc.  Thus, a shallow repository updated with git fetch --depth 1 is not quite the same as a fresh clone with --depth 1: the shallow repository probably has some lingering names for the original commits, and won't remove the extra repository objects until those names expire or are otherwise cleared-out.\n\n2Besides the reference check, objects get a minimum time before they expire as well.  The default is two weeks.  This prevents git gc from deleting temporary objects that Git is creating, but has yet to establish a reference to.  For instance, when making a new commit, Git first turns the index into a series of tree objects which refer to each other but have no top-level reference.  Then it creates a new commit object that refers to the top-level tree, but nothing yet refers to the commit.  Last, it updates the current branch name.  Until that last step finishes, the trees and new commit are unreachable!\n\nSpecial considerations for --single-branch and/or shallow clones\nI noted above that the name you give to git clone -b can refer to a tag.  For normal (non-shallow or non-single-branch) clones, this works just as one would expect: you get a regular clone, and then Git does a git checkout by the tag name.  The result is the usual detached HEAD, in a perfectly ordinary clone.\nWith shallow or single-branch clones, however, there are several unusual consequences.  These are all, to some extent, a result of Git letting the implementation show through.\nFirst, if you use --single-branch, Git alters the normal fetch configuration in the new repository.  The normal fetch configuration depends on the name you choose for the remote, but the default is origin so I will just use origin here.  It reads:\nfetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*\n\nAgain, this is the normal configuration for a normal (not single-branch) clone.  This configuration tells git fetch what to fetch, which is \"all branches\".  When you use --single-branch, though, you get instead a fetch line that refers to only the one branch:\nfetch = +refs/heads/zorg:refs/remotes/origin/zorg\n\nif you're cloning the zorg branch.\nWhichever branch you clone, that's the one that goes into the fetch line.  Each future git fetch will obey this line,3 so you won't fetch any other branches.  If you do want to fetch other branches later, you will have to alter this line, or add more lines.\nSecond, if you use --single-branch and what you clone is a tag, Git will put in a rather odd fetch line.  For instance, with git clone --single-branch -b v2.1 ... I get:\nfetch = +refs/tags/v2.1:refs/tags/v2.1\n\nThis means you will get no branches, and unless someone has moved the tag,4 git fetch will do nothing!\nThird, the default tag behavior is a bit weird due to the way git clone and git fetch obtain tags.  Remember that tags are simply a reference to one particular commit, just like branches and all other references.  There are two key differences between branches and tags, though: branches are expected to move (and tags are not), and branches get renamed (and tags don't).\nRemember that all throughout the above, we keep finding that the other (upstream) Git's master becomes our origin/master, and so on.  This is an example of the renaming process.  We also saw, briefly, precisely how that renaming works, through the fetch = line: our Git takes their refs/heads/master and changes it to our refs/remotes/origin/master.  This name is not only different-looking (origin/master), but literally can't be the same as any of our branches.  If we create a branch named origin/master,5 this branch's \"full name\" is actually refs/heads/origin/master which is different from the other full name refs/remotes/origin/master.  It's only when Git uses the shorter name that we have one (regular, local) branch named origin/master and another different (remote-tracking) branch named origin/master.  (It's a lot like being at a group where everyone is named Bruce.)\nTags don't go through all this.  The tag v2.1 is just named refs/tags/v2.1.  This means there's no way to separate \"their\" tag from \"your\" tag.  You can have either your tag, or their tag.  As long as no one ever moves a tag, this doesn't matter: if you both have the tag, it must point to the same object.  (If someone starts moving tags, things get ugly.)\nIn any case, Git implements the \"normal\" fetching of tags by a simple rule:6 when Git already has a commit, if some tag names that commit, Git copies the tag too.  With ordinary clones, the first clone gets all the tags, and then subsequent git fetch operations get the new tags.  A shallow clone, however, by definition omits some commit(s), namely everything below any graft-point in the graph.  Those commits won't pick up the tags.  They can't: to have the tags, you would need to have the commits.  Git is not allowed (except through the shallow grafts) to have the ID of a commit without actually having the commit.\n\n3You can give git fetch some refspec(s) on the command line, and those will override the default.  This applies only to a default fetch.  You may also use multiple fetch = lines in the configuration, e.g., to fetch just a specific set of branches, although the normal way to \"de-restrict\" an initially-single-branch clone is to put back the usual +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* fetch line.\n4Since tags are not supposed to move, we could just say \"this does nothing\".  If they do move, though, the + in the refspec represents the force flag, so the tag winds up moving.\n5Don't do this.  It's confusing.  Git will handle it just fine—the local branch is in the local name space, and the remote-tracking branch is in the remote-tracking name space—but it's really confusing.\n6This rule does not match the documentation.  I tested against Git version 2.10.1; older Gits might use a different method.  Git since 2.26 may also use different rules now that there is a newer, fancier protocol for git fetch and git push to use.  If you care about the precise behavior with tags, you may need to test it on your particular Git version."}]}

Hmm, for any branch, \"git rev-list branch..master\" will produce output if the branch is not up-to-date wrt (i.e. just commits on top of) master. So you need to loop through all the local heads except master to produce a report (nb \"git show-branch\" will approximately do this):\ngit for-each-ref 'refs/heads/*' | \\\n  while read rev type ref; do\n    branch=$(expr \"$ref\" : 'refs/heads/\\(.*\\)' )\n    revs=$(git rev-list $rev..master)\n    if [ -n \"$revs\" ]; then\n      echo $branch needs update\n      git diff --summary --shortstat -M -C -C $rev master\n    fi\n  done\n\nSo if you were feeling brave, you could replace that \"git diff\" with something like \"git checkout $branch && git rebase master\" (or maybe just \"git pull --rebase\" if you've set that up).

As of version 2.11 (Q4 2016), git defaults to a depth of 50. A window of size 250 is good because it scans a larger section of each object, but depth at 250 is bad because it makes every chain refer to very deep old objects, which slows down all future git operations for marginally lower disk usage.\n\nHistorical Background\nLinus suggested (see below for the full mailing list post) using git gc --aggressive only when you have, in his words, “a really bad pack” or “really horribly bad deltas,” however “almost always, in other cases, it’s actually a really bad thing to do.” The result may even leave your repository in worse condition than when you started!\nThe command he suggests for doing this properly after having imported “a long and involved history” is\ngit repack -a -d -f --depth=250 --window=250\n\nBut this assumes you have already removed unwanted gunk from your repository history and that you have followed the checklist for shrinking a repository found in the git filter-branch documentation.\n\ngit-filter-branch can be used to get rid of a subset of files, usually with some combination of --index-filter and --subdirectory-filter. People expect the resulting repository to be smaller than the original, but you need a few more steps to actually make it smaller, because Git tries hard not to lose your objects until you tell it to. First make sure that:\n\nYou really removed all variants of a filename, if a blob was moved over its lifetime. git log --name-only --follow --all -- filename can help you find renames.\nYou really filtered all refs: use --tag-name-filter cat -- --all when calling git filter-branch.\n\nThen there are two ways to get a smaller repository. A safer way is to clone, that keeps your original intact.\n\nClone it with git clone file:///path/to/repo. The clone will not have the removed objects. See git-clone. (Note that cloning with a plain path just hardlinks everything!)\n\nIf you really don’t want to clone it, for whatever reasons, check the following points instead (in this order). This is a very destructive approach, so make a backup or go back to cloning it. You have been warned.\n\nRemove the original refs backed up by git-filter-branch: say\ngit for-each-ref --format=\"%(refname)\" refs/original/ |\n  xargs -n 1 git update-ref -d\n\nExpire all reflogs with git reflog expire --expire=now --all.\nGarbage collect all unreferenced objects with git gc --prune=now (or if your git gc is not new enough to support arguments to --prune, use git repack -ad; git prune instead).\n\n\n\n\nDate: Wed, 5 Dec 2007 22:09:12 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: Linus Torvalds <torvalds at linux-foundation dot org>\nTo: Daniel Berlin <dberlin at dberlin dot org>\ncc: David Miller <davem at davemloft dot net>,\n    ismail at pardus dot org dot tr,\n    gcc at gcc dot gnu dot org,\n    git at vger dot kernel dot org\nSubject: Re: Git and GCC\nIn-Reply-To: <[email protected]>\nMessage-ID: <[email protected]>\nReferences: <[email protected]>\n            <[email protected]>\n            <[email protected]>\n            <[email protected]>\n            <[email protected]>\n\nOn Thu, 6 Dec 2007, Daniel Berlin wrote:\n\nActually, it turns out that git-gc --aggressive does this dumb thing\n    to pack files sometimes regardless of whether you converted from an\n    SVN repo or not.\n\nAbsolutely. git --aggressive is mostly dumb. It’s really only useful for\n  the case of “I know I have a really bad pack, and I want to throw away\n  all the bad packing decisions I have done.”\nTo explain this, it’s worth explaining (you are probably aware of it, but\n  let me go through the basics anyway) how git delta-chains work, and how\n  they are so different from most other systems.\nIn other SCMs, a delta-chain is generally fixed. It might be “forwards”\n  or “backwards,” and it might evolve a bit as you work with the repository,\n  but generally it’s a chain of changes to a single file represented as some\n  kind of single SCM entity. In CVS, it’s obviously the *,v file, and a lot\n  of other systems do rather similar things.\nGit also does delta-chains, but it does them a lot more “loosely.” There\n  is no fixed entity. Deltas are generated against any random other version\n  that git deems to be a good delta candidate (with various fairly\n  successful heuristics), and there are absolutely no hard grouping rules.\nThis is generally a very good thing. It’s good for various conceptual\n  reasons (i.e., git internally never really even needs to care about the whole\n  revision chain — it doesn’t really think in terms of deltas at all), but\n  it’s also great because getting rid of the inflexible delta rules means\n  that git doesn’t have any problems at all with merging two files together,\n  for example — there simply are no arbitrary *,v “revision files” that have\n  some hidden meaning.\nIt also means that the choice of deltas is a much more open-ended\n  question. If you limit the delta chain to just one file, you really don’t\n  have a lot of choices on what to do about deltas, but in git, it really\n  can be a totally different issue.\nAnd this is where the really badly named --aggressive comes in. While\n  git generally tries to re-use delta information (because it’s a good idea,\n  and it doesn’t waste CPU time re-finding all the good deltas we found\n  earlier), sometimes you want to say “let’s start all over, with a blank\n  slate, and ignore all the previous delta information, and try to generate\n  a new set of deltas.”\nSo --aggressive is not really about being aggressive, but about wasting\n  CPU time re-doing a decision we already did earlier!\nSometimes that is a good thing. Some import tools in particular could\n  generate really horribly bad deltas. Anything that uses git fast-import,\n  for example, likely doesn’t have much of a great delta layout, so it might\n  be worth saying “I want to start from a clean slate.”\nBut almost always, in other cases, it’s actually a really bad thing to do.\n  It’s going to waste CPU time, and especially if you had actually done a\n  good job at deltaing earlier, the end result isn’t going to re-use all\n  those good deltas you already found, so you’ll actually end up with a\n  much worse end result too!\nI’ll send a patch to Junio to just remove the git gc --aggressive\n  documentation. It can be useful, but it generally is useful only when you\n  really understand at a very deep level what it’s doing, and that\n  documentation doesn’t help you do that.\nGenerally, doing incremental git gc is the right approach, and better\n  than doing git gc --aggressive. It’s going to re-use old deltas, and\n  when those old deltas can’t be found (the reason for doing incremental GC\n  in the first place!) it’s going to create new ones.\nOn the other hand, it’s definitely true that an “initial import of a long\n  and involved history” is a point where it can be worth spending a lot of\n  time finding the really good deltas. Then, every user ever after (as\n  long as they don’t use git gc --aggressive to undo it!) will get the\n  advantage of that one-time event. So especially for big projects with a\n  long history, it’s probably worth doing some extra work, telling the delta\n  finding code to go wild.\nSo the equivalent of git gc --aggressive — but done properly — is to\n  do (overnight) something like\ngit repack -a -d --depth=250 --window=250\n\nwhere that depth thing is just about how deep the delta chains can be\n  (make them longer for old history — it’s worth the space overhead), and\n  the window thing is about how big an object window we want each delta\n  candidate to scan.\nAnd here, you might well want to add the -f flag (which is the “drop all\n  old deltas,” since you now are actually trying to make sure that this one\n  actually finds good candidates.\nAnd then it’s going to take forever and a day (i.e., a “do it overnight”\n  thing). But the end result is that everybody downstream from that\n  repository will get much better packs, without having to spend any effort\n  on it themselves.\n          Linus"}]}

Same command on the desktop-pc works perfectly"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, this is normal for new bare (and non-bare) repositories.\nExplanation\nHEAD is what Git calls a symbolic reference—a reference to another reference.\nIn non-bare repositories, HEAD normally indicates which branch is currently checked out.  A new commit will cause the branch named by HEAD to be advanced to refer to the new commit.  When HEAD refers to a commit object directly instead of a branch, it's considered to be detached, meaning further commits will not cause a branch reference to be advanced to refer to the new commits (dangerous because checking out a different commit or branch will render the new commits unreachable by any existing reference, making them hard to find and subject to garbage collection).\nIn bare repositories, HEAD indicates the repository's default branch, so that in a clone of the repository git checkout origin is equivalent to git checkout origin/master if master is the default branch (see git help rev-parse for details).\nWhen Git initializes a new repository, it initializes HEAD to refer to refs/heads/master (in other words, HEAD points to the master branch by default).  However, it does not create a branch named master because there are no commits in the repository for master to point to yet.\nSo until you either create a master branch or change HEAD to point to a branch that does exist, you'll get that error when you run a command that looks at HEAD (such as git log or git show without any arguments).\nYou can still use commands that don't examine HEAD.  For example:\ngit log some_branch_that_exists\n\nFix\nTo get rid of the error message, you can do one of the following:\n\nChange HEAD to point to a branch that does exist:\ngit symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/some_other_branch\n\nPush a new master branch into the repository from somewhere else\nCreate a new master branch locally:\ngit branch master some_existing_commit\n\n\nVisualization\nTo visualize everything in the repository, I use something like this:\ngit log --graph --oneline --date-order --decorate --color --all\n\nNote that the above command will work even if HEAD is pointing to a non-existent branch."}]}

I recommend you read the man pages but here is the gist:\ngit gc removes unreachable objects (commits, trees, blobs (files)). An object is unreachable if it isn't part of the history of some branch. Actually it is a bit more complicated:\nStashes are implemented using the reflog (i.e not not branches or tags). That means that they are subject to garbage collection. Or, to make it more explicit: running the above commands will delete all your stashes.\ngit gc does some other things but they are not relevant here and not dangerous.\nUnreachable objects that are younger than two weeks are not removed so we use --prune=now which means \"remove unreachable objects that were created before now\".\nObjects can also be reached through the reflog. While branches record the history of some project, reflogs record the history of these branches. If you amend, reset etc. commits are removed from the branch history but git keeps them around in case you realize that you made a mistake. Reflogs are a convenient way to find out what destructive (and other) operations were performed on a branch (or HEAD), making it easier to undo a destructive operation.\nSo we also have to remove the reflogs to actually remove everything not reachable from a branch. We do so by expiring --all reflogs. Again git keeps a bit of the reflogs to protect users so we again have to tell it not to do so: --expire-unreachable=now.\nSince I mainly use the reflog to recover from destructive operations I usually use --expire=now instead, which zaps the reflogs completely."}]}

Just remember these little gotcha's here: \n\nThe name of your package must always be scoped to your org (or username)\n\n\nE.g., name: @johndturn/my-package\n\nIf your organization has capital letters in it, like MyOrg, just replace them in the name of the package in your package.json and your .yarnrc with lowercase\n\n\nE.g., name: @myorg/my-package\nNote: When authenticating with npm login, I still have kept the uppercase letters in the --scope= argument. \n\nThe name of your package doesn't have to be the same name of the repo. \n\n\nE.g., for a repo called MyOrg/random-prefix.js-lib, you can have name: @myorg/js-lib in your package.json file for the project itself. Then, installing it in other projects will look something like @myorg/js-lib: 1.0.0."}]}

For instance, if I have several prototype applications, all independent of each other, what do I create in order to manage in an organized way the source code for all of them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fact 1: Projects and Repositories were always synonyms on GitHub.Fact 2: This is no longer the case.\nThere is a lot of confusion about Repositories and Projects. In the past both terms were used pretty much interchangeably by the users and the GitHub's very own documentation. This is reflected by some of the answers and comments here that explain the subtle differences between those terms and when the one was preferred over the other. The difference were always subtle, e.g. like the issue tracker being part of the project but not part of the repository which might be thought of as a strictly git thing etc.\nNot any more.\nCurrently repos and projects refer to a different kinds of entities that have separate APIs:\n\nhttps://developer.github.com/v3/repos/\nhttps://developer.github.com/v3/projects/\n\nSince then it is no longer correct to call the repo a project or vice versa.\nNote that it is often confused in the official documentation and it is unfortunate that a term that was already widely used has been chosen as the name of the new entity but this is the case and we have to live with that.\nThe consequence is that repos and projects are usually confused and every time you read about GitHub projects you have to wonder if it's really about the projects or about repos. Had they chosen some other name or an abbreviation like \"proj\" then we could know that what is discussed is the new type of entity, a precise object with concrete properties, or a general speaking repo-like projectish kind of thingy.\nThe term that is usually unambiguous is \"project board\".\nWhat can we learn from the API\nThe first endpoint in the documentation of the Projects API:\n\nhttps://developer.github.com/v3/projects/#list-repository-projects\n\nis described as: List repository projects. It means that a repository can have many projects. So those two cannot mean the same thing. It includes Response if projects are disabled:\n{\n  \"message\": \"Projects are disabled for this repo\",\n  \"documentation_url\": \"https://developer.github.com/v3\"\n}\n\nwhich means that some repos can have projects disabled. Again, those cannot be the same thing when a repo can have projects disabled.\nThere are some other interesting endpoints:\n\nCreate a repository project - POST /repos/:owner/:repo/projects\nCreate an organization project - POST /orgs/:org/projects\n\nbut there is no:\n\nCreate a user's project - POST /users/:user/projects\n\nWhich leads us to another difference:\n1. Repositories can belong to users or organizations2. Projects can belong to repositories or organizations\nor, more importantly:\n1. Projects can belong to repositories but not the other way around2. Projects can belong to organizations but not to users3. Repositories can belong to organizations and to users\nSee also:\n\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/\n\nI know it's confusing. I tried to explain it as precisely as I could."}]}

One feature, one branch. For this, I use a work flow described in \"A successful Git branching model\".  The only difference is that master points to CVS, but conceptually the same work flows can be applied here.  It is just a convention.\nOnce your commit is pushed in CVS, it will be back to master in the next update (git cvsimport).  Then, you can remove the local branch that implemented that feature.\nFor work in progress (in local branches), you should rebase them against master.  Because you have the features separated, it should be easier to solve conflicts.  The tricky part is when some branches depend on others, but still manageable.  Micro commits helps a lot (as in any git work flow).\nIf every local branch is rebased and master never touched (except for updates), then git \ncvsexportcommit should just work.  Remember, it works for one commit.  It is a bit tedious, but it is better than nothing.  Given the previous example the command should be something like:\n$ git cvsexportcommit -vc commit-id\n\nIf you only have read-only access to the remote CVS, then you can send the patches by email or make your git repository public, so the commiters can grab your patches to apply them.  Nothing different from a normal work flow of CVS in this case.  Again, in the next update you will see the changes in master."}]}

The first commit made on this new branch will have no parents and it will be the root of a new history totally disconnected from all the other branches and commits.\nThe index and the working tree are adjusted as if you had previously run \"git checkout <start_point>\". This allows you to start a new history that records a set of paths similar to <start_point> by easily running \"git commit -a\" to make the root commit.\nThis can be useful when you want to publish the tree from a commit without exposing its full history. You might want to do this to publish an open source branch of a project whose current tree is \"clean\", but whose full history contains proprietary or otherwise encumbered bits of code.\nIf you want to start a disconnected history that records a set of paths that is totally different from the one of <start_point>, then you should clear the index and the working tree right after creating the orphan branch by running \"git rm -rf .\" from the top level of the working tree. Afterwards you will be ready to prepare your new files, repopulating the working tree, by copying them from elsewhere, extracting a tarball, etc.\n\nHere's a link to the documentation for checkout.  You can also run git help checkout as well.\nOnce you've created your branch without history, then when you push it to the server, it won't have that history either.  FWIW, it helps me to think of git push as \"make the remote branch look the same as my local one\".  So if you have history, and push, it will have history.

Those features have been cooking since last June 2009 and debated further last December.\nThe fixup action or directive is for squashing a commit you would have manually reordered in the commit edit list of a rebase --interactive, while ignoring the second commit message, which will make the message edition step faster (you can just save it: the squashed commit will have the first commit message only)\nThe resulting commit message will only be the first commit one.\n  # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit\n  # f, fixup = like \"squash\", but discard this commit's log message\n\nThe --autosquash option is about making the commit reordering process automatically for you:\n\nIf you know what commit you want to squash something in to you can commit it with a message of “squash! $other_commit_subject”. Then if you run @git rebase --interactive --autosquash commitish@, the line will automatically be set as squash, and placed below the commit with the subject of $other_commit_subject.\n\n(Actually, the squash! can only use the beginning of another commit message)\n$ vim Foo.txt\n$ git commit -am \"Change all the 'Bar's to 'Foo's\"\n[topic 8374d8e] Change all the 'Bar's to 'Foo's\n 1 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)\n$ vim Bar.txt\n$ git commit -am \"Change all the 'Foo's to 'Bar's\"\n[topic 2d12ce8] Change all the 'Foo's to 'Bar's\n 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)\n\n$ vim Foo.txt\n$ git commit -am \"squash! Change all the 'Bar's\"\n[topic 259a7e6] squash! Change all the 'Bar's\n 1 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)\n\nSee? Here the third commit uses only the beginning of the first commit message.\nA rebase --interactive --autosquash will move the squashed commit below the relevant one:\npick 8374d8e Change all the 'Bar's to 'Foo's\nsquash 259a7e6 squash! Change all the 'Bar's\npick 2d12ce8 Change all the 'Foo's to 'Bar's\n\nThe message edition would be:\n# This is a combination of 2 commits.\n# The first commit's message is:\n\nChange all the 'Bar's to 'Foo's\n\n# This is the 2nd commit message:\n\nsquash! Change all the 'Bar's\n\nMeaning by default you would keep the squashing operation recorded in the commit message.\nBut with the fixup! directive, you could keep that squashing \"invisible\" in the commit message, while still benefiting from the automatic commit reordering with the --autosquash option (and the fact that your second commit message is based on the first commit you want to be squashed with).\npick 8374d8e Change all the 'Bar's to 'Foo's\nfixup cfc6e54 fixup! Change all the 'Bar's\npick 2d12ce8 Change all the 'Foo's to 'Bar's\n\nThe message by default will be:\n# This is a combination of 2 commits.\n# The first commit's message is:\n\nChange all the 'Bar's to 'Foo's\n\n# The 2nd commit message will be skipped:\n\n#    fixup! Change all the 'Bar's\n\n\nNotice that the fixup! commit’s message is already commented out.\nYou can just save out the message as-is, and your original commit message will be kept.\nVery handy for including changes when you realize that you forgot to add part of an earlier commit.\n\nNow if you want to fixup or squash based on the previous commit you just did, Jacob Helwig (the author of the Technosorcery Networks blog entry) recommends the following aliases:\n[alias]\n    fixup = !sh -c 'git commit -m \\\"fixup! $(git log -1 --format='\\\\''%s'\\\\'' $@)\\\"' -\n    squash = !sh -c 'git commit -m \\\"squash! $(git log -1 --format='\\\\''%s'\\\\'' $@)\\\"' -\n\nAnd for doing a rebase interactive which will always benefit from the automatic reordering of commits meant to be squashed:\n[alias]\n    ri = rebase --interactive --autosquash\n\n\nUpdate for Git 2.18 (Q2 2018): \"git rebase -i\" sometimes left intermediate \"# This is a combination of N commits\" message meant for the human consumption\ninside an editor in the final result in certain corner cases, which\nhas been fixed.\nSee commit 15ef693, commit dc4b5bc, commit e12a7ef, commit d5bc6f2 (27 Apr 2018) by Johannes Schindelin (dscho).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 4a3bf32, 23 May 2018)\n\nrebase --skip: clean up commit message after a failed fixup/squash\n\n\nDuring a series of fixup/squash commands, the interactive rebase builds\nup a commit message with comments. This will be presented to the user in\nthe editor if at least one of those commands was a squash.\nIn any case, the commit message will be cleaned up eventually, removing\nall those intermediate comments, in the final step of such a fixup/squash chain.\nHowever, if the last fixup/squash command in such a chain fails with\nmerge conflicts, and if the user then decides to skip it (or resolve it\nto a clean worktree and then continue the rebase), the current code\nfails to clean up the commit message.\nThis commit fixes that behavior.\nThe fix is quite a bit more involved than meets the eye because it is\nnot only about the question whether we are git rebase --skiping a\nfixup or squash. It is also about removing the skipped fixup/squash's\ncommit message from the accumulated commit message. And it is also about\nthe question whether we should let the user edit the final commit\nmessage or not (\"Was there a squash in the chain that was not\nskipped?\").\nFor example, in this case we will want to fix the commit message, but\nnot open it in an editor:\npick  <- succeeds\nfixup <- succeeds\nsquash    <- fails, will be skipped\n\nThis is where the newly-introduced current-fixups file comes in real\nhandy. A quick look and we can determine whether there was a non-skipped\nsquash. We only need to make sure to keep it up to date with respect to\nskipped fixup/squash commands. As a bonus, we can even avoid committing\nunnecessarily, e.g. when there was only one fixup, and it failed, and\nwas skipped.\nTo fix only the bug where the final commit message was not cleaned up\nproperly, but without fixing the rest, would have been more complicated\nthan fixing it all in one go, hence this commit lumps together more than\na single concern.\n\n\nGit 2.19 (Q3 2018) fixes a bug: When \"git rebase -i\" is told to squash two or more commits into one, it labeled the log message for each commit with its number.\nIt correctly called the first one \"1st commit\", but the next one was \"commit #1\", which was off-by-one(!).\nSee commit dd2e36e (15 Aug 2018) by Phillip Wood (phillipwood).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 36fd1e8, 20 Aug 2018)\n\nrebase -i: fix numbering in squash message\n\n\nCommit e12a7ef (\"rebase -i: Handle \"combination of <n> commits\" with\nGETTEXT_POISON\", 2018-04-27, Git 2.18) changed the way that individual commit\nmessages are labelled when squashing commits together.\nIn doing so a regression was introduced where the numbering of the messages is off by one. This commit fixes that and adds a test for the numbering.\n\n\nNote: \"git rebase -i\"(man) with a series of squash/fixup, when one of the steps stopped in conflicts and ended up getting skipped, did not handle the accumulated commit log messages, which has been corrected with Git 2.42 (Q3 2023).\nSee commit 6ce7afe (03 Aug 2023) by Phillip Wood (phillipwood).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit e8c53ff, 09 Aug 2023)\n\nrebase --skip: fix commit message clean up when skipping squash\nSigned-off-by: Phillip Wood\n\n\nDuring a series of \"fixup\" and/or \"squash\" commands, the interactive rebase accumulates a commit message from all the commits that are being squashed together.\nIf one of the commits has conflicts when it is picked and the user chooses to skip that commit then we need to remove that commit's message from accumulated messages.\nTo do this 15ef693 (\"rebase --skip: clean up commit message after a failed fixup/squash\", 2018-04-27, Git v2.18.0-rc0 -- merge listed in batch #6) updated commit_staged_changes() to reset the accumulated message to the commit message of HEAD (which does not contain the message from the skipped commit) when the last command was \"fixup\" or \"squash\" and there are no staged changes.\nUnfortunately the code to do this contains two bugs.\n\nIf parse_head() fails we pass an invalid pointer to\nunuse_commit_buffer().\n\nThe reconstructed message uses the entire commit buffer from HEAD\nincluding the headers, rather than just the commit message.\n\n\nThe first issue is fixed by splitting up the \"if\" condition into several statements each with its own error handling.\nThe second issue is fixed by finding the start of the commit message within the commit buffer using find_commit_subject().\nThe existing test added by 15ef693 is modified to show the effect of this bug.\nThe bug is triggered when skipping the first command in the chain (as the test does before this commit) but the effect is hidden because opts->current_fixup_count is set to zero which leads update_squash_messages() to recreate the squash message file from scratch overwriting the bad message created by commit_staged_changes().\nThe test is also updated to explicitly check the commit messages rather than relying on grep to ensure they do not contain any stray commit headers."}]}

If I execute git pull, then it asks for the password of one of my colleagues.\nHow can I change the remote to black?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Edit: Thanks for all the upvotes!\nIn addition to the accepted answer to this question from @axiac that describes how to set the remote repository for an existing branch in your local copy, I felt it would be worthwhile to expand on this, by noting that while a default remote cannot be setup for git pull, a default remote can be set for git checkout in your repository using the checkout.defaultRemote setting.  This way, git checkout some-branch, git push, and git pull will all Just Work™ the way you intended, without specifying or thinking about the remote name at all. Read on for a full explanation.\nNote to OP: In my examples below I'm going to use the remote name origin instead of your specific remote named black because for most people, the default origin remote is the one you'd want to setup like this.  For your purposes though, just replace any instance of origin with black.\nSimplify your branch checkout process:\nFirst, you'd type the following in the console:\ngit config checkout.defaultRemote origin\n\nThis command adds the following section to your repository's .git/config file:\n[checkout]\n     defaultRemote = origin\n\nNow, with a default branch configured, each time you want to setup a new local copy of a remote branch that exists on the \"origin\" remote repository, you only need to type:\ngit checkout some-branch\n\nAnd git will assume you actually meant:\ngit checkout --track origin/some-branch\n\nWhich can also be shortened to:\ngit checkout -u origin/some-branch\n\nThis is an amazing lifehack. It is a much smarter alternative method of setting up a local copy than the solution mentioned above with git checkout -b some-branch and is so very useful when you actually know that the branch already exists on one or more remotes.  Particularly, if you're working with multiple remotes and not using defaultRemote, you would need to type the long form git checkout --track origin/branch-name each time you checkout a branch, because git doesn't know from which remote it should track.  Save yourself a headache and just set this up always. (See final thoughts below for a suggested approach).\nSimplify your git push and git pull process:\nAs hinted at above, having your local branches auto-configured to track from the defaultRemote means that when you need to do a git pull while on some branch you checked out, git already knows exactly which remote to pull from. This is very, very helpful.\nNote: if the local branch tracks one remote and you want to pull code from a different remote, or if the local branch is not setup to track a remote at all, then you can either:\n\nmanually specify the correct remote to pull from:\n  git pull <remote-name>\n\nThis must be done each time you want to pull from the remote.\n\nfix the remote tracking branch permanently on a branch-by-branch basis using:\n  git branch --set-upstream-to <remote-name/branch-name>\n\nOR\n  git config branch.<branch-name>.remote <remote-name>\n  git config branch.<branch-name>.merge refs/heads/<branch-name>\n\nThis is a one-time change; all subsequent git pull commands should now pull from the remote/branch you specified.\n\n\nCaveats and implications:\nFor git config checkout.defaultRemote origin to be of any real benefit for a git pull command scenario, this command/configuration needs to be set up when you first start working on a project with multiple remotes, or as soon as you start adding additional remotes. The reason is because this configuration will only have an effect on branches you're going to check out after having set this configuration; it doesn't have any effect on existing branches. In which case, all existing local branches that don't already track from a specific remote will need to be modified separately to add the intended remote before a simple git pull will work.\nFinal thoughts\nIf you find yourself hitting this issue often on various projects, a more comprehensive setting would be to work under the convention that the default remote should always be added as the \"origin\" remote in all your projects. You can then set this configuration globally with:\ngit config --global checkout.defaultRemote origin"}]}

In contrast to git-submodule where only metadata is stored in the root repository, in the form of .gitmodules, and you must manage the external repositories separately.\nMore Details\ngit subtree merge strategy is basically the more manual method using the commands you referenced.\ngit-subtree is a wrapper shell script to facilitate a more natural syntax. This is actually still a part of contrib and not fully integrated into git with the usual man pages.  The documentation is instead stored along side the script.\nHere is the usage info:\nNAME\n----\ngit-subtree - Merge subtrees together and split repository into subtrees\n\n\nSYNOPSIS\n--------\n[verse]\n'git subtree' add   -P <prefix> <commit>\n'git subtree' add   -P <prefix> <repository> <ref>\n'git subtree' pull  -P <prefix> <repository> <ref>\n'git subtree' push  -P <prefix> <repository> <ref>\n'git subtree' merge -P <prefix> <commit>\n'git subtree' split -P <prefix> [OPTIONS] [<commit>]\n\nI have come across a pretty good number of resources on the subject of subtrees, as I was planning on writing a blog post of my own.  I will update this post if I do, but for now here is some relevant information to the question at hand:\nMuch of what you are seeking can be found on this Atlassian blog by Nicola Paolucci the relevant section below:\n\nWhy use subtree instead of submodule?\nThere are several reasons why\n  you might find subtree better to use:\n\nManagement of a simple workflow is easy. \nOlder version of git are supported (even before v1.5.2). \nThe sub-project’s code is available right after the clone of the super project is done. \nsubtree does not require users of your repository to learn anything new, they can ignore the fact that you are using subtree to manage dependencies.\nsubtree does not add new metadata files like submodules does (i.e.\n  .gitmodule). \nContents of the module can be modified without having a\n  separate repository copy of the dependency somewhere else. \n\nIn my opinion the drawbacks are acceptable:\n\nYou must learn about a new merge strategy (i.e. subtree). \nContributing code back upstream for the sub-projects is slightly more complicated.\nThe responsibility of not mixing super and sub-project code in commits lies with you.\n\n\nI would agree with much of this as well.  I would recommend checking out the article as it goes over some common usage.\nYou may have noticed that he has also written a follow up here where he mentions an important detail that is left off with this approach...  \ngit-subtree currently fails to include the remote!\nThis short sightedness is probably due to the fact that people often add a remote manually when dealing with subtrees, but this isn't stored in git either.  The author details a patch he has written to add this meta data to the commit that git-subtree already generates.  Until this makes it into the official git mainline you could do something similar by modifying the commit message or storing it in another commit.\nI also find this blog post very informative as well.  The author adds a third subtree method he calls git-streeto the mix.  The article is worth a read as he does a pretty good job of comparing the three approaches.

Rebasing branch with many commits is much more time consuming then simple merge.\nThere are 2 advantages that come to my mind right now:\n\ngit bisect\nPossibility of submitting with history to another version control system like SVN.\n\nAre there any other benefits?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As far as I am concerned, keeping a linear history is mostly for asthetics. It's a very good way for a very skilled, disciplined developer to tidy up the history and make it nice to skim through. In a perfect world, we should have a perfectly linear history that makes everything crystal clear.\nHowever, on a large team in an enterprise environment I often do not recommend artificially keeping a linear history. Keeping history linear on a team of sharp, experienced, and disciplined developers is a nice idea, but I often see this prescribed as a 'best practice' or some kind of 'must do'. I disagree with such notions, as the world is not perfect, and there are a lot of costs to keeping a linear history that people do not do a good job of disclosing. Here's the bullet list overview:\n\nRewriting history can include erasing history\nNot everybody can even rebase\nThe benefits are often overstated\n\nNow, let's dig into that. Warning: Long, anecdotal, mostly ranting\nRewriting history can include erasing history\nHere's the problem with rebasing all of your commits to keep everything nice and linear: Rebasing is not generally loss-less. There is information- real, actual things that were done by the developer - that may be compressed out of your history when you rebase. Sometimes, that's a good thing. If a developer catches their own mistake, it's nice for them to do an interactive rebase to tidy that up. Caught-and-fixed mistakes have already been handled: we don't need a history of them. But some people work with that one individual who always seems to screw up merge conflicts. I don't personally know any developers named Neal, so let's say it's a guy named Neal. Neal is working on some really tricky accounts receivable code on a feature branch. The code Neal wrote on his branch is 100% correct and works exactly the way we want it to. Neal gets his code all ready to get merged into master, only to find there are merge conflicts now. If Neal merges master into his feature branch, we have a history of what his code originally was, plus what his code looked like after resolving the merge conflicts. If Neal does a rebase, we only have his code after the rebase. If Neal makes a mistake when resolving merge conflicts, it will be a lot easier to troubleshoot the the former than it will be the latter. But worse, if Neal screws up his rebase in a sufficiently unfortunate way (maybe he did a git checkout --ours, but he forgot he had important changes in that file), we could altogether lose portions of his code forever.\nI get it, I get it. His unit tests should have caught the mistake. The code reviewer should have caught the mistake. QA should have caught the mistake. He shouldn't have messed up resolving the merge conflicts in the first place. Blah, blah, don't care. Neal is retired, the CFO is pissed because our ledger is all screwed up, and telling the CFO 'according to our development philosophy this shouldn't have happened' is going to get me punched in the face.\nNot everybody can even rebase, bro. Yes, I've heard: You work at some space age startup, and your IoT coffee table uses only the coolest and most modern, reactive, block-chain based recurrent neural network, and the tech stack is sick! Your lead developer was literally there when Go was invented, and everybody who works there has been a Linux kernel contributor since they were 11. I'd love to hear more, but I just don't have time with how often I'm being asked 'How do I exit git diff???'. Every time someone tries to rebase to resolve their conflicts with master, I get asked 'why does it say my file is their file', or 'WHY DO I ONLY SEE PART OF MY CHANGE', and yet most developers can handle merging master into their branch without incident. Maybe that shouldn't be the case, but it is. When you have junior devs and interns, busy people, and people who didn't find out what source control is until they had already been a programmer for 35 years on your team, it takes a lot of work to keep the history pristine.\nThe benefits are often overstated.\nWe've all been on that one project where you do git log --graph --pretty and suddenly your terminal has been taken over by rainbow spaghetti. But history is not hard to read because it's non-linear...It's hard to read because it's sloppy. A sloppy linear history where every commit message is \".\" is not going to be easier to read than a relatively clean non-linear history with thoughtful commit messages. Having a non-linear history does not mean you have to have branches being merged back and forth with each other several times before reaching master. It does not mean that your branches have to live for 6 months. An occasional branch on your history graph is not the end of the world.\nI also don't think doing a git bisect is that much more difficult with non-linear history. A skilled developer should be able to think of plenty of ways to get the job done. Here's one article I like with a decent example of one way to do it.\nhttps://blog.smart.ly/2015/02/03/git-bisect-debugging-with-feature-branches/\ntldr; I'm not saying rebases and linear history aren't great. I'm just saying you need to understand what you're signing up for and make an informed decision about whether or not it's right for your team. A perfectly linear history is not a necessity, and it certainly isn't free. It can definitely make life great in the right circumstances, but it will not make sense for everyone."}]}

In particular, git checkout is designed to not touch any files that are identical in both branches.\nUnfortunately, RCS keyword substitution breaks this. For example, using $Date$ would  require git checkout to touch every file in the tree when switching branches. For a repository the size of the Linux kernel, this would bring everything to a screeching halt.\nIn general, your best bet is to tag at least one version:\n$ git tag v0.5.whatever\n\n...and then call the following command from your Makefile:\n$ git describe --tags\nv0.5.15.1-6-g61cde1d\n\nHere, git is telling me that I'm working on an anonymous version 6 commits past v0.5.15.1, with an SHA1 hash beginning with g61cde1d. If you stick the output of this command into a *.h file somewhere, you're in business, and will have no problem linking the released software back to the source code. This is the preferred way of doing things.\nIf you can't possibly avoid using RCS keywords, you may want to start with this explanation by Lars Hjemli. Basically, $Id$ is pretty easy, and you if you're using git archive, you can also use $Format$.\nBut, if you absolutely cannot avoid RCS keywords, the following should get you started:\ngit config filter.rcs-keyword.clean 'perl -pe \"s/\\\\\\$Date[^\\\\\\$]*\\\\\\$/\\\\\\$Date\\\\\\$/\"'\ngit config filter.rcs-keyword.smudge 'perl -pe \"s/\\\\\\$Date[^\\\\\\$]*\\\\\\$/\\\\\\$Date: `date`\\\\\\$/\"'\n\necho '$Date$' > test.html\necho 'test.html filter=rcs-keyword' >> .gitattributes\ngit add test.html .gitattributes\ngit commit -m \"Experimental RCS keyword support for git\"\n\nrm test.html\ngit checkout test.html\ncat test.html\n\nOn my system, I get:\n$Date: Tue Sep 16 10:15:02 EDT 2008$\n\nIf you have trouble getting the shell escapes in the smudge and clean commands to work, just write your own Perl scripts for expanding and removing RCS keywords, respectively, and use those scripts as your filter.\nNote that you really don't want to do this for more files than absolutely necessary, or git will lose most of its speed."}]}

You didn't actually commit any of these -- you were \"in the zone\", as they say, and you didn't want to think about splitting up the commits the right way just then. (And you're smart enough not to make the whole thing one honking big commit!).\nNow the change is all tested and working, you need to commit all this properly, in several clean commits each focused on one aspect of the code changes.\nWith the index, just stage each set of changes and commit until no more changes are pending. Really works well with git gui if you're into that too, or you can use git add -p or, with newer gits, git add -e.\n\nstaging helps in reviewing changes - Staging helps you \"check off\" individual changes as you review a complex commit, and to concentrate on the stuff that has not yet passed your review. Let me explain. Before you commit, you'll probably review the whole change by using git diff. If you stage each change as you review it, you'll find that you can concentrate better on the changes that are not yet staged. git gui is great here. It's two left panes show unstaged and staged changes respectively, and you can move files between those two panes (stage/unstage) just by clicking on the icon to the left of the filename. Even better, you can even stage partial changes to a file. In the right pane of git gui, right click on a change that you approve of and choose \"stage hunk\". Just that change (not the entire file) is now staged; in fact, if there are other, unstaged, changes in that same file, you'll find that the file now appears on both top and bottom left panes!\n\nstaging helps when a merge has conflicts - When a merge happens, changes that merge cleanly are updated both in the staging area as well as in your work tree. Only changes that did not merge cleanly (i.e., caused a conflict) will show up when you do a git diff, or in the top left pane of git gui. Again, this lets you concentrate on the stuff that needs your attention -- the merge conflicts.\n\nstaging helps you keep extra local files hanging around - Usually, files that should not be committed go into .gitignore or the local variant, .git/info/exclude. However, sometimes you want a local change to a file that cannot be excluded (which is not good practice but can happen sometimes). For example, perhaps you upgraded your build environment and it now requires an extra flag or option for compatibility, but if you commit the change to the Makefile, the other developers will have a problem. Of course you have to discuss with your team and work out a more permanent solution, but right now, you need that change in your working tree to do any work at all! Another situation could be that you want a new local file that is temporary, and you don't want to bother with the ignore mechanism. This may be some test data, a log file or trace file, or a temporary shell script to automate some test... whatever. In git, all you have to do is never to stage that file or that change. That's it.\n\nstaging helps you sneak in small changes - Let's say you're in the middle of a somewhat large-ish change and you are told about a very important bug that needs to be fixed asap. The usual recommendation is to do this on a separate branch, but let's say this fix is really just a line or two, and can be tested just as easily without affecting your current work. With git, you can quickly make and commit only that change, without committing all the other stuff you're still working on. Again, if you use git gui, whatever's on the bottom left pane gets committed, so just make sure only that change gets there and commit, then push!"}]}

Since it is a Central VCS, several developers can collaborate on a same branch, with pessimistic or optimistic locks on files, in order to develop a parallel history.\nBut being a VCS has two major impact on branching:\n\nIt tends to discourage commits, because once a file is committed, it will immediately influence the workspace of other views with the same configuration (i.e. \"working on the same branch\").\n~ The \"publication\" process is an active one, with immediate consequences,\n~ while the \"consuming\" part (updating your workspace) is a passive one (you are forced to deal with changes published by other immediately upon update of your workspace)   \nIt works well for linear merge workflow (i.e. \"only merge from branch A to branch B, not mixing merges in both directions\" -- A to B to A to B...). The merges are trivial, all modifications from A are simply carried over to B\n\nNow:\nImplementing a feature\nAny VCS will do that by making a branch, but what greatly surprised me is that a \"feature\" branch is not easy:\n* the feature may grow too complicated\n* it may be ready in time for the next release\n* only some part of it may need to be merged back into the main development branch\n* it may depend on other features which are not fully done yet\nSo you need to be careful in the way you manage your feature branch, and your commits: if they are tightly related to the same feature, it will go well (you merge the whole thing back to your main development branch when you need it). Otherwise, partial merges are not easy with those tools.\nFixing bugs\nThe difference between bug fix during development and after release is that, in the former case you can often do it linearly in the same branch, as in the latter case you will have to establish a bug-fix branch, and decide what bugs you will need to back-port to your current development branch.\nCode Review\nIt is best used with external tools (like Crucible for instance), and uses VCS functions like blame or annotations extensively, in order to better assign code fixes after a review.\nRefactoring code (post code-review)\nIf the refactoring is minor, it can go on in the same branch. But if it is big, a special branch needs to be setup, with unit-testing done before beginning said refactoring.\nIncorporate patches\nSame comment as last point. If the patch is a big one, a branch needs to be created.\nReleasing the newer version of your app\nA VCS will only get you so far when it comes to releasing your app, because it is not a release management tool.\nYou will need to formerly identify a version to be released (label), but after that comes the deployment process which involves:  \n\nstopping what is currently running\ncopying the new files\ndeploying them (updating sql database, webapp, ...)\ninstantiating all config files (with the right values, addresses, port number, paths, ...)\nrestarting (and if your system is composed of several components, restarting them in the right order!)\n\nThe key things with VCS and release management are:\n\nthey are not very well adapted to store binaries to be released, meaning you need them to build your app, not to store the resulting executable\nthey are not always welcome in the production environment (where security constraints limit writing access, as well as the number of tools running on those platforms, essentially monitoring and reporting tools)\n\nThe release mechanism also has an influence on binary dependencies:\n\nfor external binary dependencies, you will probably use mechanisms like maven to get fixed revisions of external libraries\nbut for internal dependencies, when you are not developing just one app but several which depends one upon an other, you need to know how to reference the binaries produced by the other apps (internal binary dependencies), and they usually won't be stored in your VCS (especially in the development phase, where you can produce a lot of different releases for your other apps to be able to use) \n\nYou can also choose to be in source dependencies (and get all the sources of the other internal projects you need for your own), and a VCS is well adapted for that, but it is not always possible/practical to recompile everything."}]}

I'm just looking for data which makes it clear how to expect git to operate with each of the three settings.\n--\nUpdate 04/17/2012: After reading the article by Tim Clem linked by JJD in the comments, I have modified some of the values in the \"unknown\" values in the table above, as well as changing \"checkout existing | true to convert to CRLF instead of convert to client\".  Here are the definitions he gives, which are more clear than anything I've seen elsewhere:\ncore.autocrlf = false\n\nThis is the default, but most people are encouraged to change this\nimmediately. The result of using false is that Git doesn’t ever mess\nwith line endings on your file. You can check in files with LF or CRLF\nor CR or some random mix of those three and Git does not care. This\ncan make diffs harder to read and merges more difficult. Most people\nworking in a Unix/Linux world use this value because they don’t have\nCRLF problems and they don’t need Git to be doing extra work whenever\nfiles are written to the object database or written out into the\nworking directory.\n\ncore.autocrlf = true\n\nThis means that Git will process all text files and make sure that\nCRLF is replaced with LF when writing that file to the object database\nand turn all LF back into CRLF when writing out into the working\ndirectory. This is the recommended setting on Windows because it\nensures that your repository can be used on other platforms while\nretaining CRLF in your working directory.\n\ncore.autocrlf = input\n\nThis means that Git will process all text files and make sure that\nCRLF is replaced with LF when writing that file to the object\ndatabase. It will not, however, do the reverse. When you read files\nback out of the object database and write them into the working\ndirectory they will still have LFs to denote the end of line. This\nsetting is generally used on Unix/Linux/OS X to prevent CRLFs from\ngetting written into the repository. The idea being that if you pasted\ncode from a web browser and accidentally got CRLFs into one of your\nfiles, Git would make sure they were replaced with LFs when you wrote\nto the object database.\n\nTim's article is excellent, the only thing I can think of that is missing is that he assumes the repository is in LF format, which is not necessarily true, especially for Windows only projects.\nComparing Tim's article to the highest voted answer to date by jmlane shows perfect agreement on the true and input settings and disagreement on the false setting."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best explanation of how core.autocrlf works is found on the gitattributes man page, in the text attribute section.\nThis is how core.autocrlf appears to work currently (or at least since v1.7.2 from what I am aware):\n\ncore.autocrlf = true\n\n\nText files checked-out from the repository that have only LF characters are normalized to CRLF in your working tree; files that contain CRLF in the repository will not be touched\nText files that have only LF characters in the repository, are normalized from CRLF to LF when committed back to the repository. Files that contain CRLF in the repository will be committed untouched.\n\n\ncore.autocrlf = input\n\n\nText files checked-out from the repository will keep original EOL characters in your working tree.\nText files in your working tree with CRLF characters are normalized to LF when committed back to the repository.\n\n\ncore.autocrlf = false\n\n\ncore.eol dictates EOL characters in the text files of your working tree.\ncore.eol = native by default, which means working tree EOLs will depend on where git is running: CRLF on a Windows machine, or LF in *nix.\nRepository gitattributes settings determines EOL character normalization for commits to the repository (default is normalization to LF characters).\n\nI've only just recently researched this issue and I also find the situation to be very convoluted.

To find out how to identify each of these, see the (very) long answer below.  (Unfortunately, it got a bit out of hand and I do not have time to shorten it.)\nThe problem you have here is that in Git, branches don't have a \"starting point\"—at least, not in any useful way.\nThe term \"branch\", in Git, is ambiguous\nThe first issue here is that, in Git, the word \"branch\" has at least two distinct meanings.  Usually, when we talk loosely about \"the branch\", it's clear from context whether we mean the branch name—the thing that's a word like master or develop or feature-X—or the thing that I call \"branch ancestry\" or \"branch structure\", or more informally, a \"DAGlet\".1  See also What exactly do we mean by \"branch\"?\nIn this particular case, unfortunately, you mean both of these, at the same time.\n\n1The term DAG is short for Directed Acyclic Graph, which is what the commit graph is: a set of vertices or nodes, and directional (from child to parent) edges, such that there are no cycles through the directed edges from any node back to itself.  To this I simply add the \"-let\" diminutive suffix.  The resulting word has a happy resemblance to the word aglet, plus a certain assonance with the word \"dagger\", making it sound slightly dangerous: \"Is this a DAGlet which I see before me?\"\nDraw your commit graph\nWhenever you need to grapple with these issues, it helps to draw a graph of what you have now, or at least some useful subset of what you have now.  There are of course many ways to draw this (see that linked question for several options, including some bad ones :-) ), but in plain text in a StackOverflow answer, I generally draw them like this:\n...--o--o--o           <-- master\n         \\\n          o--o--o--o   <-- develop\n\nThe round o nodes represent commits, and the branch names master and develop point to one specific tip commit on each branch.\nIn Git, every commit points back to its parent commit(s), and this is how Git forms branch structures.  By \"branch structures\", I mean here particular subsets of the overall ancestry part of the graph, or what I call the DAGlets.  The name master points to the tip-most commit of the master branch, and that commit points back (leftward) to another commit that is the previous commit on the branch, and that commit points leftward again, and so on.\nWhen we need to talk about specific commits within this graph, we can use their actual names, which are the big ugly 40-character hashes that identify each Git object.  Those are really clumsy though, so what I do here is replace the little round os with uppercase letters:\n...--A--B--C           <-- master\n         \\\n          D--E--F--G   <-- develop\n\nand now it's easy to say, e.g., that the name master points to commit C, and C points to B, and B points to A, which points back to more history that we don't really care about and hence just left as ....\nWhere does a branch begin?\nNow, it's perfectly obvious, to you and me, based on this graph drawing, that branch develop, whose tip commit is G, starts at commit D.  But it's not obvious to Git—and if we draw the same graph a little differently, it may be less obvious to you and me too.  For instance, look at this drawing:\n          o             <-- X\n         /\n...--o--o--o--o--o--o   <-- Y\n\nObviously branch X has just the one commit and the main line is Y, right?  But let's put some letters in:\n          C             <-- X\n         /\n...--A--B--D--E--F--G   <-- Y\n\nand then move Y down a line:\n          C            <-- X\n         /\n...--A--B\n         \\\n          D--E--F--G   <-- Y\n\nand then look what happens if we move C down to the main line, and realize that X is master and Y is develop?  Which branch is commit B on after all?\nIn Git, commits may be on many branches simultaneously; DAGlets are up to you\nGit's answer to this dilemma is that commits A and B are on both branches.  The beginning of branch X is way off to the left, in the ... part.  But so is the beginning of branch Y.  As far as Git is concerned, a branch \"starts\" at whatever root commit(s) it can find in the graph.\nThis is important to keep in mind in general.  Git has no real concept of where a branch \"started\", so we wind up having to give it extra information.  Sometimes that information is implied, and sometimes it is explicit.  It's also important, in general, to remember that commits are often on many branches—so instead of specifying branches, we usually specify commits.\nWe just often use branch names to do this.  But if we give Git just a branch name, and tell it to find all the ancestors of the tip commit of that branch, Git goes all the way back in history.\nIn your case, if you write the name develop and ask Git to select that commit and its ancestors, you get commits D-E-F-G (which you wanted) and commit B, and commit A, and so on (which you didn't).  The trick, then, is to somehow identify which commits you don't want, along with which commits you do.\nNormally we use the two-dot X..Y syntax\nWith most Git commands, when we want to select some particular DAGlet, we use the two-dot syntax described in gitrevisions, such as master..develop.  Most2 Git commands that work on multiple commits treat this as: \"Select all commits starting from the tip of the develop branch, but then subtract from that set, the set of all commits starting from the tip of the master branch.\"  Look back at our graph drawing of master and develop: this says \"do take commits starting from G and working backwards\"—which gets us too many, since it includes commits B and A and earlier—\"but exclude commits starting from C and working backwards.\"  It's that exclude part that gets us what we want.\nHence, writing master..develop is how we name commits D-E-F-G, and have Git compute that automatically for us, without having to first sit down and draw out a big chunk of the graph.\n\n2Two notable exceptions are git rebase, which is in its own section just below, and git diff.  The git diff command treats X..Y as simply meaning X Y, i.e., it effectively just ignores the two dots entirely.  Note that this has a very different effect than set subtraction: in our case, git diff master..develop simply diffs the tree for commit C against the tree for commit G, even though master..develop never has commit C in the first set.\nIn other words, mathematically speaking, master..develop is normally ancestors(develop) - ancestors(master), where the ancestors function includes the specified commit, i.e., is testing ≤ rather than just <.  Note that ancestors(develop) does not include commit C at all.  The set subtraction operation simply ignores the presence of C in the set ancestors(master).  But when you feed this to git diff, it does not ignore C: it does not diff, say, B against G.  While that might be a reasonable thing to do, git diff instead steals the three-dot master...develop syntax to accomplish this.\nGit's rebase is a little bit special\nThe rebase command is almost always used to move3 one of these DAGlet commit-subsets from one point in the graph to another.  In fact, that's what rebase is, or was originally anyway, defined to do.  (Now it has a fancy interactive rebase mode, which does this and a bunch more history editing operations.  Mercurial has a similar command, hg histedit, with a slightly better name, and much tighter default semantics.4)\nSince we always (or almost always) want to move a DAGlet, git rebase builds in this subset selection for us.  And, since we always (or almost always) want to move the DAGlet to come just after the tip of some other branch, git rebase defaults to choosing the target (or --onto) commit using a branch name, and then uses that same branch name in the X..Y syntax.5\n\n3Technically, git rebase actually copies commits, rather than moving them.  It has to, because commits are immutable, like all Git's internal objects.  The true name, the SHA-1 hash, of a commit is a checksum of the bits making up the commit, so any time you change anything—including something as simple as the parent ID—you have to make a new, slightly-different, commit.\n4In Mercurial, quite unlike Git, branches really do have starting points, and—more important for histedit—commits record their phase: secret, draft, or published.  History editing readily applies to secret or draft-phase commits, and not so much to published commits.  This is true of Git as well, but since Git has no concept of commit phases, Git's rebase must use these other techniques.\n5Technically the <upstream> and --onto arguments can just be raw commit IDs.  Note that 1234567..develop works just fine as a range selector, and you can rebase --onto 1234567 to place the new commits after commit 1234567.  The only place that git rebase truly needs a branch name is for the name of the current branch, which it normally just reads from HEAD anyway.  However, we usually want to use a name, so that's how I describe it all here.\n\nThat is, if we're currently on branch develop, and in this situation that we drew before:\n...--A--B--C           <-- master\n         \\\n          D--E--F--G   <-- develop\n\nwe probably just want to move the D-E-F-G chain onto the tip of master, to get this:\n...--A--B--C              <-- master\n            \\\n             D'-E'-F'-G'  <-- develop\n\n(The reason I changed the names from D-E-F-G to D'-E'-F'-G' is that rebase is forced to copy the original commits, rather than actually moving them.  The new copies are just as good as the originals, and we can use the same single letter name, but we should at least note, however vaguely, that these are in fact copies.  That's what the \"prime\" marks, the ' characters, are for.)\nBecause this is what we usually want, git rebase will do this automatically if we just name the other branch.  That is, we're on develop now:\n$ git checkout develop\n\nand we want to rebase commits that are on branch develop and are not on master, moving them to the tip of master.  We might express this as git somecmd master..develop master, but then we would have to type the word master twice (such a dreadful fate).  So instead, Git's rebase infers this when we just type in:\n$ git rebase master\n\nThe name master becomes the left side of the two-dot .. DAGlet selector, and the name master also becomes the target of the rebase; and Git then rebases D-E-F-G onto C.  Git gets our branch's name, develop, by reading out the current branch name.  In fact, it uses a shortcut, which is that when you need the current branch name, you can normally just write HEAD instead.  So master..develop and master..HEAD mean the same thing, because HEAD is develop.\nGit's rebase calls this name the <upstream>.  That is, when we say git rebase master, Git claims, in the documentation, that master is the <upstream> argument to git rebase.  The rebase command then operates on commits in <upstream>..HEAD, copying them after whatever commit is in <upstream>.\nThis is going to become a problem for us soon, but for now, just make note of it.\n(Rebase also has the sneaky, but desirable, side feature of omitting any of the D-E-F-G commits that sufficiently resembles commit C.  For our purposes we can ignore this.)\nWhat's wrong with the other answer to this question\nIn case the other answer gets deleted, or becomes one of several other answers, I'll summarize it here as \"use git branch -f to move the branch label.\"  The flaw in the other answer—and, perhaps more importantly, precisely when it's a problem—becomes obvious once we draw our graph DAGlets.\nBranch names are unique, but tip commits are not necessarily so\nLet's take a look at what happens when you run git checkout -b newbranch starting-point.  This asks Git to root around in the current graph for the given starting-point, and make the new branch label point to that specific commit.  (I know I said above that branches don't have a starting point.  This is still mostly true: we're giving the git checkout command a starting point now, but Git is about to set it and then, crucially, forget it.)  Let's say that starting-point is another branch name, and let's draw a whole bunch of branches:\n          o--o--o--o     <-- brA\n         /\n...--o--o--o--o--o--o    <-- brB\n            \\\n             o--o--o     <-- brC\n                 \\\n                  o--o   <-- brD\n\nSince we have four branch names, we have four branch tips: four branch-tip commits, identified by the names brA through brD.  We pick one and make a new branch name newbranch that points to the same commit as one of these four.  I have arbitrarily picked brA here:\n          o--o--o--o     <-- brA, newbranch\n         /\n...--o--o--o--o--o--o    <-- brB\n            \\\n             o--o--o     <-- brC\n                 \\\n                  o--o   <-- brD\n\nWe now have five names, and five ... er, four? ... well, some tip commits.  The tricky bit is that brA and newbranch both point to the same tip commit.\nGit knows—because git checkout sets it—that we're now on newbranch.  Specifically Git writes the name newbranch into HEAD.  We can make our drawing a bit more accurate by adding this information:\n          o--o--o--o     <-- brA, HEAD -> newbranch\n         /\n...--o--o--o--o--o--o    <-- brB\n            \\\n             o--o--o     <-- brC\n                 \\\n                  o--o   <-- brD\n\nAt this point, the four commits that used to be only on branch brA are now on both brA and newbranch.  And, by the same token, Git no longer knows that newbranch starts at the tip of brA.  As far as Git is concerned, both brA and newbranch contain those four commits and all the earlier ones too, and both of them \"start\" way back in time somewhere.\nWhen we make new commits, the current name moves\nSince we're on branch newbranch, if we make a new commit now, the new commit's parent will be the old tip commit, and Git will adjust the branch name newbranch to point to the new commit:\n                     o   <-- HEAD -> newbranch\n                    /\n          o--o--o--o     <-- brA\n         /\n...--o--o--o--o--o--o    <-- brB\n            \\\n             o--o--o     <-- brC\n                 \\\n                  o--o   <-- brD\n\nNote that none of the other labels moved: the four \"old\" branches stay put, only the current (HEAD) branch changes.  It changes to accommodate the new commit we just made.\nNote that Git continues to have no idea that branch newbranch \"started\" at brA.  It's just the case, now, that newbranch contains one commit that brA does not, plus the four commits that they both contain, plus all those earlier commits.\nWhat git branch -f does\nUsing git branch -f lets us move a branch label.  Let's say, for whatever mysterious reason, we don't want branch label brB to point where it does in our current drawing.  Instead, we want it to point to the same commit as brC.  We can use git branch -f to change the place to which brB points, i.e., to move the label:\n$ git branch -f brB brC\n\n                     o   <-- HEAD -> newbranch\n                    /\n          o--o--o--o     <-- brA\n         /\n...--o--o--o--o--o--o    [abandoned]\n            \\\n             o--o--o     <-- brC, brB\n                 \\\n                  o--o   <-- brD\n\nThis makes Git \"forget\" or \"abandon\" those three commits that were only on brB before.  That's probably a bad idea—why did we decide to do this strange thing?—so we probably want to put brB back.\nReflogs\nFortunately, \"abandoned\" commits are normally remembered in what Git calls reflogs.  Reflogs use an extended syntax, name@{selector}.  The selector part is usually either a number or date, such as brB@{1} or brB@{yesterday}.  Every time Git updates a branch name to point to some commit, it writes a reflog entry for that branch, with the pointed-to commit's ID, a time-stamp, and an optional message.  Run git reflog brB to see these.  The git branch -f command wrote the new target as brB@{0}, bumping up all the old numbers, so now brB@{1} names the previous tip commit.  So:\n$ git branch -f brB 'brB@{1}'\n    # you may not need the quotes, 'brB@{...}' --\n    # I need them in my shell, otherwise the shell\n    # eats the braces.  Some shells do, some don't.\n\nwill put it back (and also renumber all the numbers again: each update replaces the old @{0} and makes it @{1}, and @{1} becomes @{2}, and so on).\nAnyway, suppose that we do our git checkout -b newbranch while we're on brC, and fail to mention brA.  That is, we start with:\n          o--o--o--o     <-- brA\n         /\n...--o--o--o--o--o--o    <-- brB\n            \\\n             o--o--o     <-- HEAD -> brC\n                 \\\n                  o--o   <-- brD\n\nand run git checkout -b newbranch.  Then we get this:\n          o--o--o--o     <-- brA\n         /\n...--o--o--o--o--o--o    <-- brB\n            \\\n             o--o--o     <-- brC, HEAD -> newbranch\n                 \\\n                  o--o   <-- brD\n\nIf we meant to make newbranch point to commit brA, we can in fact do that right now, with git branch -f.  But let's say we make a new commit before realizing that we made newbranch start at the wrong point.  Let's draw it in:\n          o--o--o--o     <-- brA\n         /\n...--o--o--o--o--o--o    <-- brB\n            \\\n             o--o--o     <-- brC\n                 \\  \\\n                 |   o   <-- HEAD -> newbranch\n                 \\\n                  o--o   <-- brD\n\nIf we use git branch -f now, we'll abandon—lose—the commit we just made.  What we want instead is to rebase it, onto the commit that branch brA points-to.\nA simple git rebase copies too much\nWhat if, instead of using git branch -f, we use git rebase brA?  Let's analyze this using—what else—our DAGlets.  We start with the above drawing above, with the extended leg going out to brD, though in the end we get to ignore that leg, and with the section going to brB, most of which we also get to ignore.  What we don't get to ignore is all that stuff in the middle, that we get by tracing the lines back.\nThe git rebase command, in this form, will use brA..newbranch to pick commits to copy.  So, starting with the whole DAGlet, let's mark (with *) all the commits that are on (or contained in) newbranch:\n          o--o--o--o     <-- brA\n         /\n...--*--*--*--o--o--o    <-- brB\n            \\\n             *--*--*     <-- brC\n                 \\  \\\n                 |   *   <-- HEAD -> newbranch\n                 \\\n                  o--o   <-- brD\n\nNow, let's un-mark (with x) all the commits that are on (or contained in) brA:\n          x--x--x--x     <-- brA\n         /\n...--x--x--*--o--o--o    <-- brB\n            \\\n             *--*--*     <-- brC\n                 \\  \\\n                 |   *   <-- HEAD -> newbranch\n                 \\\n                  o--o   <-- brD\n\nWhatever remains—all the * commits—are the ones that git rebase will copy.  That's way too many!\nWe need to get git rebase to copy just the one commit.  What this means is that for the <upstream> argument, we need to give git rebase the name brC.6  That way, Git will use brC..HEAD to select the commits to copy, which will be just the one commit we need to copy.\nBut—alas!—now we have a big problem, because git rebase wants to copy the commit to a point right after the <upstream> we just gave it.  That is, it wants to copy the commits to just after brC.  That's where the commits are now!  (Well, the one commit is.)  So this is no good at all!\nFortunately, git rebase has an escape hatch, specifically the --onto argument.  I mentioned this several times before, but now is when we need it.  We want the copies to go right after brA, so that's what we will supply as the --onto argument.  Git's rebase uses the <upstream> by default, but if we give it an --onto, it uses that instead.  So:\n$ git branch   # just checking...\n  brA\n  brB\n  brC\n  brD\n  master\n* newbranch\n\nOK, good, we're still on newbranch.  (Note that git status works here too, and if you use one of those fancy shell prompt setup things, you can even get your current branch name to be in your prompt, so that you don't need to run git status as often.)\n$ git rebase --onto brA brC\n\nNow Git will select commits in brC..HEAD, which is the right set of commits to copy, and copy them right after the tip of brA, which is the right place to copy them to.  Once the copies are all done, Git will abandon the original commits7 and make the name newbranch point to the new, tip-most, copied commit.\nNote that this works even if you have no new commits on the new branch.  This is the one case where git branch -f also works.  When there are no commits, this git rebase carefully copies all zero of them :-) and then makes the name, newbranch, point to the same commit as brA.  Hence git branch -f is not always wrong; but git rebase is always right—albeit somewhat clumsy: you must identify both the <upstream> and the --onto points manually.\n\n6Or, as we noted in an earlier footnote, we can give git rebase the ID of the commit to which the name brC points.  Either way, we have to supply this as the upstream argument.\n7Except, of course, reflog entry newbranch@{1} will remember the old, now-abandoned, tip commit.  Additional reflog entries for newbranch may remember yet more commits, and remembering the tip commit suffices to keep all its ancestors alive.  The reflog entries eventually expire—after 30 days for some cases, and 90 for others, by default—but this gives you up to a month or so, by default, to recover from mistakes."}]}

We've made some number of commits, five of which changed a given file, and we want to revert the file to one of the previous versions. First of all, git doesn't keep version numbers for individual files. It just tracks content - a commit is essentially a snapshot of the work tree, along with some metadata (e.g. commit message). So, we have to know which commit has the version of the file we want. Once we know that, we'll need to make a new commit reverting the file to that state. (We can't just muck around with history, because we've already pushed this content, and editing history messes with everyone else.)\nSo let's start with finding the right commit. You can see the commits which have made modifications to given file(s) very easily:\ngit log path/to/file\n\nIf your commit messages aren't good enough, and you need to see what was done to the file in each commit, use the -p/--patch option:\ngit log -p path/to/file\n\nOr, if you prefer the graphical view of gitk\ngitk path/to/file\n\nYou can also do this once you've started gitk through the view menu; one of the options for a view is a list of paths to include.\nEither way, you'll be able to find the SHA1 (hash) of the commit with the version of the file you want. Now, all you have to do is this:\n# get the version of the file from the given commit\ngit checkout <commit> path/to/file\n# and commit this modification\ngit commit\n\n(The checkout command first reads the file into the index, then copies it into the work tree, so there's no need to use git add to add it to the index in preparation for committing.)\nIf your file may not have a simple history (e.g. renames and copies), see VonC's excellent comment. git can be directed to search more carefully for such things, at the expense of speed. If you're confident the history's simple, you needn't bother."}]}

Also we have about 10-20 devs total."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I use Perforce at work. I also use Git because I would still like some form of version control when I'm working on code and can't connect to the server. No, reconcile offline work just is not the same. Here is where I've found git to be a great benefit:\n\nBranching speed - git takes a few seconds at most.\nConflicts - P4Merge's auto resolve destroyed a week's worth of work once. Ever since then I would rather resolve by hand when merging. When Git prompts me about a conflict, it is actually a conflict. The rest of the time, git resolves stuff correctly and I save heaps of time.\nKeeping track of merges - If you have one branch that is continuously receiving merges from two other branches, you know what a headache this can be with perforce. With git, the headache is minimized because the result of a merge in git is actually a new commit which knows who its ancestors are.\nPermissions - I have lost track of the number of times I've tried to work on a file but couldn't because it was not checked out in Perforce. If you worked with XCode (or any editor that does not have a solid Perforce SCM plugin) offline, you know how irritating this can get. I don't have to worry about that with Git. I make my changes. Git does not stop me and tracks them in the background.\nKeeping the main tree tidy - With git, I can sort my commits and tidy the code up so that the history looks nice and tidy. None of that \"checking in this file because it was supposed to be part of the previous checkin\" rubbish. I squash commits like that, because they help nobody.\nStashing - Your perforce server needs to be version 2010.1 or newer to use the p4 shelve command.\nCreating patches - Easy to do in git. Don't know if it is possible in Perforce without using the command line. \nMailing patches from the GUI - again, git wins here.\nDisk space - With perforce, every branch is a copy. That means if your source tree is huge, your disk space gets eaten up fast. This is not even counting the additional space once you start building. Why even have a link between branches and disk space? With git, you can have 100 branches and only one branch at a time ever exists. If you specifically want to work on two versions simultaneously you can clone, do your work and then get rid of one clone if you want, without losing anything.\nIf you're on XCode4, perforce support has been dropped and git support is now built in. If you do cross platform work like I do, this matters a lot. With Visual Studio, you can use git extensions. With perforce, it's equally yuck on both OSes. Well, maybe a little more on mac now with XCode4 on the scene.\nFinding the faulty checkin (or, git bisect rules) - Ever tried to do a binary search with perforce to figure out where a bug was introduced? Quite a hassle, yes? Even more of a hassle when there have been integrates from other branches in the middle. Why? Because there is no automation for such tasks. You need to write your own tool to talk to perforce and you usually don't have the time. With git, you give it the starting points (the \"good\" point and the \"bad\" point) and it automates the search for you. Even better, if you have a script that can automate the build and test process, you can hook git up to the script and the whole process of finding the checkin is automated. That is how it should be. \nTracking changes across refactors - Try splitting BigClass into SmallClass1 and SmallClass2. To Perforce, BigClass has now ceased to exist and two new classes (SmallClass1 and SmallClass2 have joined the source tree). To Perforce, there is no relation between BigClass and SmallClass1 and SmallClass2. Git, on the other hand, is smart enough to know that x% of BigClass is now in SmallClass1 and y% of BigClass is in SmallClass2 and that BigClass has ceased to exist. Now, from the point of view of someone who is reviewing changes across multiple branches, you tell me which approach you'd find more useful - Git's or Perforce's. Personally, I prefer Git's approach because it more accurately reflects the actual change in the code. Git is able to do this because it tracks content within the file and not the file itself.\nCentralized or decentralized: Git is a DVCS system while perforce is centralized. A centralized VCS cannot be decentralized later, but a DVCS (especially git) can be centralized. There are several products that add very fine grained access control to git, if that is something the business needs. Personally, I would go with a system that gives me greater flexibility in the long term.\nBranch mappings: If you want to do branching right in Perforce, you need to create a branch mapping. There are reasons for this, but they are tied to how Perforce conceptualizes a branch. As a developer, or a team, this simply means one more step in the work flow, which I do not consider efficient at all.\nSharing work between teams: With Perforce, you cannot break up a submission. Team A is working on feature A. Team B on feature B. Team C works on bug fixes. Now, Teams A & B have to fix a bunch of bugs in order to implement their features. The only thing is, they weren't so disciplined when committing their changes (probably because they're rushing to a deadline) and so their \"bug fixes\" are parts of larger submissions that also contain new stuff as far as version control on their branches are concerned. However, Team C is now doing a point release and would like to get the bug fixes from the other teams. If they were using Git, Team C could cherry pick the other teams' relevant changes, split them up and only take what they needed without worrying about introducing any partially implemented features. With Perforce, Team C can get the affected files, but would have to separate the relevant changes using a much more manual process. \nChanging platform - If, for whatever reason in the future, you\n decide to change your platform of choice, with Perforce, you're at\n the mercy of Perforce.com and the availability of the tools for the\n platform of your choosing.\nChanging to future amazing source control engine X - If you decide\n to change what you use for source control, extracting your source\n control history from Perforce and moving it to new system X is\n going to be a nightmare, because it is closed source and the best you\n can do is guess - just Google for Perforce to Git migration to get\n a sense of what I'm talking about. At least with Git, its open\n source, so it eliminates a lot of the guesswork involved.\n\nWell, that's my 2 cents. In Perforce's defense, I gotta say their customer support rules and so does their Time Lapse View tool. I do not know how to get a time lapse view with git. But for the convenience and time saved, I'd go with git any day."}]}

In practice, that file defines which branch should be checked out by default after cloning the repository.\nNote that the warning only means that git didn't do checkout. The cloned repository is otherwise just fine. Just do git branch -a to see possible branches and git checkout the-branch-you-want to workaround the issue.\nThis usually happens because the default contents for that file (.git/HEAD or plain HEAD for bare repositories) is literal string ref: refs/heads/master which says that if somebody is going to clone this repository, they should by default clone the branch refs/heads/master. By default Git will create local branch without the refs/heads/ prefix (that is, master by default). Try git help symbolic-ref for more information.\nThe problem with this situation is that Git does not provide a method for modifying remote symbolic refs so either you use something the Git hosting provider has implemented (e.g. Settings - Default branch in GitHub if you have admin rights) or you have to use branch name master as the default branch (because that's the default content for the file HEAD and if you cannot modify that file, you'll be stuck with master forever).\nIf you have a shell access to your remote git repo, you can simply open a shell on the remote matchine and execute cd path/to/git/repo; git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/XYZ where XYZ is the branch name you want to use by default.\nOne way to hit this issue is to create a new remote bare repo with no commits and then do git push name-of-the-remote my-special-branch-name which will result in bare repository containing a single branch my-special-branch-name but the HEAD symbolic ref still contains the default value pointing to master. As a result, you'll get the aforementioned warning. If you cannot modify the remote HEAD file, you can publish your branch using syntax git push name-of-the-remote my-special-branch-name:master meaning that your local branch called my-special-branch-name should be published as branch master on the remote."}]}

This volume will server as a storage for caches and artifacts that you are using during the build.\n\nThe second thing - You will have at least 2 containers involved in each stage: gitlab-runner-helper, container and the container created from the image you specified (in .gitlab-ci.yml or in config.toml). What gitlab-runner-helper container does it, essentially, just cloning the remote git repository (that you are building) in the aforementioned docker volume along with caches and artifacts.\n\n\nIt can do it becuase within gitlab-runner-helper image itself are 2 important utilities: git (obviously - to clone the repo) and gitlab-runner-helper binary (this utility can pull and push artifacts, caches)\n\nThe gitlab-runner-helper container starts before each stage for a couple of seconds, to pull artifacts and caches, and then terminates. After that the container, created from image that you specified will be launched, ant it will also have this volume (from step 1) attached - this is how it receives artifacts btw.\n\nThe rest of the details about the registry from where gitlab-runner-helper get pulled are described by @Nicolas pretty well.

I am unclear, however, about what seems to be a difference between the LDAP and SAML approaches: users with accounts created via an LDAP sign-in can then access Git repositories (e.g. using clone, push, ...) using their LDAP usernames and passwords, but users with accounts created via a SAML sign-in cannot. \nThrough experimentation, I’ve found that users can access the Git repositories if they use the GitLab UI to set a separate GitLab account password on the account that is created during the initial SAML interaction. I was pointed in this direction by a GitLab message that appeared after creating a project under one of the new user accounts: 'You won't be able to pull or push project code via HTTPS until you set a password on your account'. \nIt seems possible that this separate password configuration is only necessary because I’ve misconfigured the SAML integration somehow.

In contrast, when given a user's LDAP password GitLab can connect directly to the LDAP server and verify the identity. \nMany GitLab users utilize a combination of LDAP and SAML.

Just make sure you don't make any edits to files in the same commit as your directory restructuring.\nWhy It Works\nGit is a content tracker, not a file tracker. If you move/rename files, but make no other changes to the content of those files, then Git just rewrites the tree objects. The file blobs are not changed by directory operations; directory location information is stored separately in tree objects.\nActual rename detection is handled by diffing the blobs and trees, and looking for a configurable percentage of similarity between files. This means that Git doesn't really store moves or renames directly; it computes them from differences between commits.\nThe upshot of all this is that your history is not tied to a particular filename or directory structure. This works really well for most use cases, but stands in contrast to systems like Bazaar that track renames as first-class operations."}]}

I'd advise you to get into git to fully understand how to push your code to openshift. Nevertheless let me try to explain you the steps involved:\nAs you'd do with git in general, the approach to choose here is to clone your other git repo (ex. on bitbucket) to your local machine: \ngit clone <bitbucket-repo-url>\nYour local clone has then your other repo (bitbucket etc.) as remote repo. Your remote repo is stored with the alias \"origin\" (the default alias used by git if you clone). You then add the openshift repo as remote to your clone. You do that while explicitly using an alias for the remote repo you add - I'm using \"openshift\" as alias here:\ngit remote add openshift -f <openshift-git-repo-url>\nIn order to then be able to push the code from your local git repo to openshift you first have to merge your openshift repo with your local bitbucket clone. You do that by issuing locally:\ngit merge openshift/master -s recursive -X ours\nWith this command you tell git to merge the master branch in the openshift git repo with your local git repo. You tell it to merge using the recursive merging strategy and to choose your (\"ours\") version when there are conflicts.\nOnce the merge is executed you're ready to push your git repo to openshift. You do that by doing:\ngit push openshift HEAD\nYou tell git to push your local code to the HEAD branch on the remote repo called \"openshift\" (the alias we stored the openshift git repo at, some paragraphs further up).\nbtw. I wrote a jboss tools blog which was demonstrating how to use the openshift-java-client some months ago: https://community.jboss.org/wiki/Enable-openshift-ciFullExampleUsingOpenshift-java-client . You'll spot the above steps in the last paragraph \"We're almost there\"."}]}

Nobody has been able to break SHA-1, but the point is, SHA-1 as far as git is concerned, isn't even a security feature. It's purely a consistency check.\n   The security parts are elsewhere. A lot of people assume since git uses SHA-1 and SHA-1 is used for cryptographically secure stuff, they think that it's a huge security feature. It has nothing at all to do with security, it's just the best hash you can get. \nHaving a good hash is good for being able to trust your data, it happens to have some other good features, too, it means when we hash objects, we know the hash is well distributed and we do not have to worry about certain distribution issues. \nInternally it means from the implementation standpoint, we can trust that the hash is so good that we can use hashing algorithms and know there are no bad cases. \nSo there are some reasons to like the cryptographic side too, but it's really about the ability to trust your data.\n  I guarantee you, if you put your data in git, you can trust the fact that five years later, after it is converted from your harddisc to DVD to whatever new technology and you copied it along, five years later you can verify the data you get back out is the exact same data you put in. And that is something you really should look for in a source code management system. \n\n\nUpdate Dec. 2017 with Git 2.16 (Q1 2018): this effort to support an alternative SHA is underway: see \"Why doesn't Git use more modern SHA?\".\n\nI mentioned in \"How would git handle a SHA-1 collision on a blob?\" that you could engineer a commit with a particular SHA1 prefix (still an extremely costly endeavor).\nBut the point remains, as Eric Sink  mentions in \"Git: Cryptographic Hashes\" (Version Control by Example (2011) book:\n\nIt is rather important that the DVCS never encounter two different pieces of data which have the same digest. Fortunately, good cryptographic hash functions are designed to make such collisions extremely unlikely.\n\nIt is harder to find good non-cryptographic hash with low collision rate, unless you consider research like \"Finding State-of-the-Art Non-cryptographic Hashes with Genetic Programming\".\nYou can also read \"Consider use of non-cryptographic hash algorithm for hashing speed-up\", which mentions for instance \"xxhash\", an extremely fast non-cryptographic Hash algorithm, working at speeds close to RAM limits.\n\nDiscussions around changing the hash in Git are not new:\n\neither to optimize it (August 2009), but you have to take license issue:\n\n(Linus Torvalds)\n\nThere's not really anything remaining of the mozilla code, but hey, I started from it. In retrospect I probably should have started from the PPC asm code that already did the blocking sanely - but that's a \"20/20 hindsight\" kind of thing.\nPlus hey, the mozilla code being a horrid pile of crud was why I was so convinced that I could improve on things. So that's a kind of source for  it, even if it's more about the motivational side than any actual remaining code ;)\n\nAnd you need to be careful about how to measure the actual optimization gain\n(Linus Torvalds)\n\nI pretty much can guarantee you that it improves things only because it makes gcc generate crap code, which then hides some of the P4 issues.\n\n\nor to change it altogether (January 2010)\n(for instance to SHA-3, but that would apply to any other hash):\n\n(John Tapsell - johnflux)\n\nThe engineering cost for upgrading git from SHA-1 to a new algorithm is much higher. I'm not sure how it can be done well. \nFirst of all we probably need to deploy a version of git (let's call it version 2 for this conversation) which allows there to be a slot for a new hash value even though it doesn't read or use that space -- it just uses the SHA-1 hash value which is in the other slot. \nThat way once we eventually deploy yet a newer version of git, let's call it version 3, which produces SHA-3 hashes in addition to SHA-1 hashes, people using git version 2 will be able to continue to inter-operate.\n  (Although, per this discussion, they may be vulnerable and people who rely on their SHA-1-only patches may be vulnerable.)\n\nIn short, switching to any hash is not easy.\n\nUpdate February 2017: yes, it is in theory possible to compute a colliding SHA1: shattered.io\n\nHow is GIT affected?\nGIT strongly relies on SHA-1 for the identification and integrity checking of all file objects and commits.\n  It is essentially possible to create two GIT repositories with the same head commit hash and different contents, say a benign source code and a backdoored one.\n  An attacker could potentially selectively serve either repository to targeted users. This will require attackers to compute their own collision. \n\nBut:\n\nThis attack required over 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 SHA1 computations. This took the equivalent processing power as 6,500 years of single-CPU computations and 110 years of single-GPU computations. \n\nSo let's not panic just yet.\nSee more at \"How would Git handle a SHA-1 collision on a blob?\"."}]}

It sort of makes sense if you think about it a certain way: since you're specifying a specific ref to fetch, it doesn't have to look up anything about your remote branches, so it doesn't inherently know what remote branch it should update. It of course could figure it out, and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets fixed eventually, but that's the existing behavior. (There may be messages on the mailing list about it - I don't know.)\nYou can easily work around it, though. If you use git pull origin/master, since you're specifying what to fetch via a remote branch, it should update that remote branch. And if you're on your master branch anyway (or any other branch tracking origin/master), you can just do git pull and let it fill in the defaults, and it will update remote branches.\nThis is documented in the git-pull man page, most concisely under EXAMPLES but also elsewhere. The relevant part:\n\nMerge into the current branch the remote branch next:\n$ git pull origin next\n\nThis leaves a copy of next temporarily in FETCH_HEAD, but does not update any remote-tracking branches. Using remote-tracking branches, the same can be done by invoking fetch and merge:\n$ git fetch origin\n$ git merge origin/next"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is it better to keep Git repository inside or outside of Eclipse workspace?\nI am a typical Eclipse/Subversion user beginning the migration to Git. I've researched the basic concepts of git and have decided to stick to a one project per repository approach initially to keep things simple. I am still having trouble, though, deciding where to place the repository for each project.\nI have spent a lot of time reviewing the answers to this question, although I believe the author of that question was assuming that you can only use Eclipse to manage the repository if the repository is located within the Eclipse workspace, which is, of course, not true.\nThe thing that struck me most about that question, though, was the fact that all but one answer (including the accepted answer) suggested keeping the repository inside the Eclipse workspace, whereas only one answer pointed out that the EGit User Guide recommends the exact opposite.\nIt would appear in practice, however, that there are a number of approaches implemented by Eclipse/EGit, some of which seem to contradict the EGit recommendations.\nFor example, if you use the New Project Wizard to create a New PHP Project from Git and the repository is remote, Eclipse/EGit will happily create a project folder in the Eclipse workspace and put the repository (.git) in the project folder. This is the end result that I actually want, as it keeps everything encapsulated within the Eclipse workspace.\nHowever, if you use the New Project Wizard and select a Git repository that is local, Eclipse/EGit doesn't clone the repository like it does for remote repositories. Instead it uses the working copy of that repository as the project location, creates its .project and other meta stuff in that location and also creates a new (seemingly unnecessary) folder within that working copy with the same name as your project (so you end up with, for example,  ~/git/blah/blah). If you delete that superfluous folder you end up with a structure that is identical to the first example, the only difference being that the project folder is not a sub-folder of your Eclipse workspace folder, it is somewhere else on your file system (eg. ~/git/blah). The only positive thing this approach seems to have going for it is that it adheres to the recommendations in the EGit User Guide, but from a technical perspective, its hard to see how this is really all that different to the first example.\nGiven these puzzling observations, I'm wondering what sort of experiences people have had using each of these approaches and what the pitfalls might be if one ignores the recommendations in the EGit User Guide."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The implications of both solutions are listed directly in the user guide that you linked. I can tell you that the part\n\nThis can result in performance issues\n\nis unfortunately very true. So if you have a git directory with a huge number of files inside your workspace, many git operations will start with a \"counting objects...\" dialog that blocks your IDE because it scans all files in the workspace. For my current 20000 files this means waiting 10 to 20 seconds for every commit, every switch, ...\nIn spare time activities, where I can fortunately use the other alternative (having the git working directory outside the workspace) everything feels much snappier and it is fun to merge and switch.\nSo if you go for large projects, consider the git directory outside the workspace as first choice."}]}

Is there any way to get back those changes?\nAlso, I have made some changes on top of the stashed code files since.  \nIs there any chance I can retrieve the stashed changes to a new branch if possible?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The easy answer to the easy question is git stash apply\nJust check out the branch you want your changes on, and then git stash apply.  Then use git diff to see the result.\nAfter you're all done with your changes—the apply looks good and you're sure you don't need the stash any more—then use git stash drop to get rid of it.\nI always suggest using git stash apply rather than git stash pop.  The difference is that apply leaves the stash around for easy re-try of the apply, or for looking at, etc.  If pop is able to extract the stash, it will immediately also drop it, and if you subsequently realize that you wanted to extract it somewhere else (in a different branch), or with --index, or some such, that's not so easy.  If you apply, you get to choose when to drop.\nIt's all pretty minor one way or the other though, and for a newbie to Git, it should be about the same.  (And you can skip all the rest of this!)\n\nWhat if you're doing more-advanced or more-complicated stuff?\nThere are at least three or four different \"ways to use git stash\", as it were.  The above is for \"way 1\", the \"easy way\":\n\nYou started with a clean branch, were working on some changes, and then realized you were doing them in the wrong branch.  You just want to take the changes you have now and \"move\" them to another branch.\n\nThis is the easy case, described above.  Run git stash save (or plain git stash, same thing).  Check out the other branch and use git stash apply.  This gets Git to merge in your earlier changes, using Git's rather powerful merge mechanism.  Inspect the results carefully (with git diff) to see if you like them, and if you do, use git stash drop to drop the stash.  You're done!\n\nYou started some changes and stashed them.  Then you switched to another branch and started more changes, forgetting that you had the stashed ones.\n\nNow you want to keep, or even move, these changes, and apply your stash too.\nYou can in fact git stash save again, as git stash makes a \"stack\" of changes.  If you do that, you have two stashes, one just called stash—but you can also write stash@{0}—and one spelled stash@{1}.  Use git stash list (at any time) to see them all.  The newest is always the lowest-numbered.  When you git stash drop, it drops the newest, and the one that was stash@{1} moves to the top of the stack.  If you had, even more, the one that was stash@{2} becomes stash@{1}, and so on.\nYou can apply and then drop a specific stash, too: git stash apply stash@{2}, and so on.  Dropping a specific stash renumbers only the higher-numbered ones.  Again, the one without a number is also stash@{0}.\nIf you pile up a lot of stashes, it can get fairly messy (was the stash I wanted stash@{7} or was it stash@{4}?  Wait, I just pushed another, now they're 8 and 5?).  I personally prefer to transfer these changes to a new branch, because branches have names, and cleanup-attempt-in-December means a lot more to me than stash@{12}.  (The git stash command takes an optional save-message, and those can help, but somehow, all my stashes just wind up named WIP on branch.)\n\n(Extra-advanced) You've used git stash save -p, or carefully git add-ed and/or git rm-ed specific bits of your code before running git stash save.  You had one version in the stashed index/staging area and another (different) version in the working tree.  You want to preserve all this.  So now you use git stash apply --index, and that sometimes fails with:\nConflicts in index.  Try without --index.\n\n\nYou're using git stash save --keep-index in order to test \"what will be committed\".  This one is beyond the scope of this answer; see this other StackOverflow answer instead.\n\n\nFor complicated cases, I recommend starting in a \"clean\" working tree first, by committing any changes you have now (on a new branch if you like).  That way the \"somewhere\" that you are applying them, has nothing else in it, and you'll just be trying the stashed changes:\ngit status               # see if there's anything you need to commit\n                         # uh oh, there is - let's put it on a new temp branch\ngit checkout -b temp     # create new temp branch to save stuff\ngit add ...              # add (and/or remove) stuff as needed\ngit commit               # save first set of changes\n\nNow you're on a \"clean\" starting point.  Or maybe it goes more like this:\ngit status               # see if there's anything you need to commit\n                         # status says \"nothing to commit\"\ngit checkout -b temp     # optional: create a new branch for \"apply\"\ngit stash apply          # apply stashed changes; see below about --index\n\nThe main thing to remember is that the \"stash\" is a commit, it's just a slightly \"funny/weird\" commit that's not \"on a branch\".  The apply operation looks at what the commit changed and tries to repeat it wherever you are now.  The stash will still be there (apply keeps it around), so you can look at it more, or decide this was the wrong place to apply it and try again differently, or whatever.\n\nAny time you have a stash, you can use git stash show -p to see a simplified version of what's in the stash.  (This simplified version looks only at the \"final work tree\" changes, not the saved index changes that --index restores separately.)  The command git stash apply, without --index, just tries to make those same changes in your working tree now.\nThis is true even if you already have some changes.  The apply command is happy to apply a stash to a modified working tree (or at least, to try to apply it).  You can, for instance, do this:\ngit stash apply stash      # apply top of stash stack\ngit stash apply stash@{1}  # and mix in next stash stack entry too\n\nYou can choose the \"apply\" order here, picking out particular stashes to apply in a particular sequence.  Note, however, that each time you're basically doing a \"git merge\", and as the merge documentation warns:\n\nRunning git merge with non-trivial uncommitted changes is\ndiscouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that is hard\nto back out of in the case of a conflict.\n\nIf you start with a clean tree and are just doing several git apply operations, it's easy to back out: use git reset --hard to get back to the clean state, and change your apply operations.  (That's why I recommend starting in a clean working tree first, for these complicated cases.)\n\nWhat about the very worst possible case?\nLet's say you're doing Lots Of Advanced Git Stuff, and you've made a stash, and want to git stash apply --index, but it's no longer possible to apply the saved stash with --index because the branch has diverged too much since the time you saved it.\nThis is what git stash branch is for.\nIf you:\n\ncheck out the exact commit you were on when you did the original stash, then\ncreate a new branch, and finally\ngit stash apply --index\n\nthe attempt to re-create the changes definitely will work.  This is what git stash branch newbranch does.  (And it then drops the stash since it was successfully applied.)\n\nSome final words about --index (what the heck is it?)\nWhat the --index does is simple to explain, but a bit complicated internally:\n\nWhen you have changes, you have to git add (or \"stage\") them before commit-ing.\nThus, when you ran git stash, you might have edited both files foo and zorg, but only staged one of those.\nSo when you ask to get the stash back, it might be nice if it git adds the added things and does not git add the non-added things.  That is, if you are add-ed foo but not zorg back before you did the stash, it might be nice to have that exact same setup.  What was staged, should again be staged; what was modified but not staged, should again be modified but not staged.\n\nThe --index flag to apply tries to set things up this way.  If your working tree is clean, this usually just works.  If your working tree already has stuff add-ed, though, you can see how there might be some problems here.  If you leave out --index, the apply operation does not attempt to preserve the whole staged/unstaged setup.  Instead, it just invokes Git's merge machinery, using the working tree commit in the \"stash bag\".  If you don't care about preserving staged/unstaged, leaving out --index makes it a lot easier for git stash apply to do its thing."}]}

That's expected, because both features (and master) have changes in the same areas. But the strange thing is that the same conflict keeps reappearing after git rebase --continue. This drives us crazy, so we end up aborting the rebase, and use git merge. It turns out the conflicts are actually easy to resolve.\nMy question is two-fold:\n\nIs git rebase suitable for our situation? Or is rebase only good for pulling in a few (e.g., 1 or 2) changes?\nWhat is happening under the hood that causes the same conflict to reappear again and again?

It's best used to merge local branches, that is branches that only exist in your local repository and haven't been published to other people. Why? Because of at least two reasons:\n\nRebasing changes the commit IDs (i.e. the SHA-1 hashes of their metadata). This means that once you push the rebased commits to the shared branch, they will appear as completely new commits to anyone that fetches them on their local repo, even if they still contain the same changes. Now, if someone has added new commits on top of the old ones in the meantime, they will have to move them. This creates unnecessary confusion.\nWhen you merge public branches you often want to have those merge commits in order to be able to track how commits moved across branches. That information is lost with rebasing.\n\nWhat's happening under the hood?\nJust a regular merge. The difference is that git rebase merges one commit at a time on top of the previous one starting from the common parent. git merge merges two commits – with their entire set of changes – as a single operation, so you only have to resolve the conflicts once.\nUpdate: Resolving recurring conflicts\nAs @Jubobs pointed out in the comments, Git does have an automated solution for resolving conflicts that occur multiple times: git rerere, or \"reuse recorded resolution\".\nAfter you enable rerere in your configuration file (rerere.enabled true) every time a merge conflict occurs, Git will record the state of the conflicting files before and after you merge them. Next time the same conflict occurs – a conflict involving the exact same lines on both sides of the merge – Git will automatically apply the same resolution it had recorded previously. It will also let you know about it in the merge output:\n\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in 'somefile'\n  Resolved 'somefile' using previous resolution.\n\nHere you can find more details on how to deal with conflicts using git rerere."}]}

You need to use a token belonging to an account with cluster-admin privileges, so GitLab can use it for authenticating and installing stuff on the cluster. The easiest way to achieve this is by creating a new account for GitLab: create a YAML file with the service account definition (an example can be seen here under Create a gitlab service account in the default namespace) and apply it to your cluster by means of kubectl apply -f serviceaccount.yml.\nProject namespace (optional, unique): I leave it empty, don't know yet for what or where this namespace can be used.\n\nClick in \"Save\" and it's done. Your GitLab project must be connected to your Kubernetes cluster now.\nDeploy\nIn your deploy job (in the pipeline), you'll need some environment variables to access your cluster using the kubectl command, here is a list of all the variables available:\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/index.html#deployment-variables\nTo have these variables injected in your deploy job, there are some conditions:\n\nYou must have added correctly the Kubernetes cluster into your GitLab project, menu \"Operations\" > \"Kubernetes\" and these steps that I described above\nYour job must be a \"deployment job\", in GitLab CI, to be considered a deployment job, your job definition (in your .gitlab-ci.yml) must have an environment key (take a look at the line 31 in this example), and the environment name must match the name you used in menu \"Operations\" > \"Environments\".\n\nHere are an example of a .gitlab-ci.yml with three stages:\n\nBuild: it builds a docker image and push it to gitlab private registry\nTest: it doesn't do anything yet, just put an exit 0 to change it later\nDeploy: download a stable version of kubectl, copy the .kube/config file to be able to run kubectl commands in the cluster and executes a kubectl cluster-info to make sure it is working.

The -local option has no effect for --date=relative . --date=local is an alias for --date=default-local . --date=iso (or --date=iso8601 ) shows timestamps in a ISO 8601-like format.\nThe differences to the strict ISO 8601 format are: a space instead of the T date/time delimiter a space between time and time zone no colon between hours and minutes of the time zone --date=iso-strict (or --date=iso8601-strict ) shows timestamps in strict\nISO 8601 format. --date=rfc (or --date=rfc2822 ) shows timestamps in RFC 2822\nformat, often found in email messages. --date=short shows only the date, but not the time, in YYYY-MM-DD format. --date=raw shows the date as seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01\n00:00:00 UTC), followed by a space, and then the timezone as an offset\nfrom UTC (a + or - with four digits; the first two are hours, and\nthe second two are minutes). I.e., as if the timestamp were formatted\nwith strftime(\"%s %z\") ).\nNote that the -local option does not affect the seconds-since-epoch\nvalue (which is always measured in UTC), but does switch the accompanying\ntimezone value. --date=human shows the timezone if the timezone does not match the\ncurrent time-zone, and doesn’t print the whole date if that matches\n(ie skip printing year for dates that are \"this year\", but also skip\nthe whole date itself if it’s in the last few days and we can just say\nwhat weekday it was).  For older dates the hour and minute is also\nomitted. --date=unix shows the date as a Unix epoch timestamp (seconds since\n1970).  As with --raw , this is always in UTC and therefore -local has no effect. --date=format:... feeds the format ... to your system strftime ,\nexcept for %s, %z, and %Z, which are handled internally.\nUse --date=format:%c to show the date in your system locale’s\npreferred format.  See the strftime manual for a complete list of\nformat placeholders. When using -local , the correct syntax is --date=format-local:... . --date=default is the default format, and is based on ctime(3)\noutput.  It shows a single line with three-letter day of the week,\nthree-letter month, day-of-month, hour-minute-seconds in \"HH:MM:SS\"\nformat, followed by 4-digit year, plus timezone information, unless\nthe local time zone is used, e.g. Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 1970 +0000 ."}]}

Consider it like a broker or manager in this case. The agent would spawn the runners inside the cluster with the configuration you have setup.\nFor example, in my case, I have a node-pool dedicated specifically for gitlab runners. These nodes are more expensive to run, since they're higher-spec than the standard nodes used by the rest of the cluster, so I want to make sure only the GitLab runners spawn on there. I configure the Runner to have a node selector and toleration pointing at that specific node pool so the cluster scales up that node pool to put the runner on it.\nThe agent itself provides way more functionality than just spawning runners, but your question only asks about the GitLab agent and Runner.

Thank you for asking it!\nHowever, I found that the answers I see here don't seem to quite give the answer you asked for (or that I was looking for) -- they seem to give the G commit, instead of the A commit.\nSo, I've created the following tree (letters assigned in chronological order), so I could test things out:\nA - B - D - F - G   <- \"master\" branch (at G)\n     \\   \\     /\n      C - E --'     <- \"topic\" branch (still at E)\n\nThis looks a little different than yours, because I wanted to make sure that I got (referring to this graph, not yours) B, but not A (and not D or E).  Here are the letters attached to SHA prefixes and commit messages (my repo can be cloned from here, if that's interesting to anyone):\nG: a9546a2 merge from topic back to master\nF: e7c863d commit on master after master was merged to topic\nE: 648ca35 merging master onto topic\nD: 37ad159 post-branch commit on master\nC: 132ee2a first commit on topic branch\nB: 6aafd7f second commit on master before branching\nA: 4112403 initial commit on master\n\nSo, the goal: find B.  Here are three ways that I found, after a bit of tinkering:\n\n1. visually, with gitk:\nYou should visually see a tree like this (as viewed from master):\n\nor here (as viewed from topic):\n\nin both cases, I've selected the commit that is B in my graph.  Once you click on it, its full SHA is presented in a text input field just below the graph.\n\n2. visually, but from the terminal:\ngit log --graph --oneline --all\n(Edit/side-note: adding --decorate can also be interesting; it adds an indication of branch names, tags, etc.  Not adding this to the command-line above since the output below doesn't reflect its use.)\nwhich shows (assuming git config --global color.ui auto):\n\nOr, in straight text:\n\n*   a9546a2 merge from topic back to master\n|\\  \n| *   648ca35 merging master onto topic\n| |\\  \n| * | 132ee2a first commit on topic branch\n* | | e7c863d commit on master after master was merged to topic\n| |/  \n|/|   \n* | 37ad159 post-branch commit on master\n|/  \n* 6aafd7f second commit on master before branching\n* 4112403 initial commit on master\n\nin either case, we see the 6aafd7f commit as the lowest common point, i.e. B in my graph, or A in yours.\n\n3. With shell magic:\nYou don't specify in your question whether you wanted something like the above, or a single command that'll just get you the one revision, and nothing else.  Well, here's the latter:\ndiff -u <(git rev-list --first-parent topic) \\\n             <(git rev-list --first-parent master) | \\\n     sed -ne 's/^ //p' | head -1\n6aafd7ff98017c816033df18395c5c1e7829960d\n\nWhich you can also put into your ~/.gitconfig as (note: trailing dash is important; thanks Brian for bringing attention to that):\n[alias]\n    oldest-ancestor = !zsh -c 'diff -u <(git rev-list --first-parent \"${1:-master}\") <(git rev-list --first-parent \"${2:-HEAD}\") | sed -ne \\\"s/^ //p\\\" | head -1' -\n\nWhich could be done via the following (convoluted with quoting) command-line:\ngit config --global alias.oldest-ancestor '!zsh -c '\\''diff -u <(git rev-list --first-parent \"${1:-master}\") <(git rev-list --first-parent \"${2:-HEAD}\") | sed -ne \"s/^ //p\" | head -1'\\'' -'\n\nNote: zsh could just as easily have been bash, but sh will not work -- the <() syntax doesn't exist in vanilla sh.  (Thank you again, @conny, for making me aware of it in a comment on another answer on this page!)\nNote: Alternate version of the above:\nThanks to liori for pointing out that the above could fall down when comparing identical branches, and coming up with an alternate diff form which removes the sed form from the mix, and makes this \"safer\" (i.e. it returns a result (namely, the most recent commit) even when you compare master to master):\nAs a .git-config line:\n[alias]\n    oldest-ancestor = !zsh -c 'diff --old-line-format='' --new-line-format='' <(git rev-list --first-parent \"${1:-master}\") <(git rev-list --first-parent \"${2:-HEAD}\") | head -1' -\n\nFrom the shell:\ngit config --global alias.oldest-ancestor '!zsh -c '\\''diff --old-line-format='' --new-line-format='' <(git rev-list --first-parent \"${1:-master}\") <(git rev-list --first-parent \"${2:-HEAD}\") | head -1'\\'' -'\n\nSo, in my test tree (which was unavailable for a while, sorry; it's back), that now works on both master and topic (giving commits G and B, respectively).  Thanks again, liori, for the alternate form.\n\nSo, that's what I [and liori] came up with.  It seems to work for me.  It also allows an additional couple of aliases that might prove handy:\ngit config --global alias.branchdiff '!sh -c \"git diff `git oldest-ancestor`..\"'\ngit config --global alias.branchlog '!sh -c \"git log `git oldest-ancestor`..\"'\n\nHappy git-ing!"}]}

If not, it simply aborts with an error message (and does not create any commits).\n\nUpdate 1: \nIf you have Git 2.29 or above, you can now set pull.ff to false, true or only to get rid of the warning.\ngit config pull.ff true\n\ntrue - This is the default behaviour. Pull is fast-forwarded if possible, otherwise it's merged.\ngit config pull.ff false\n\nfalse - Pull is never fast-forwarded, and a merge is always created.\ngit config pull.ff only\n\nonly - Pull is fast-forwarded if possible, otherwise operation is aborted with an error message.\n\nUpdate 2: \nThere was a bug in this newly implemented feature until version 2.35 where Git would show this warning even if the user passed one of the three flags with the git pull command. This has now been fixed, consider updating your Git to version 2.36 or above.\n\nNotes:\n\nRead this very well written answer by torek to get a much clearer picture on what actually happens behind the scene and to understand which option is the most appropriate option for you.\n\nYou may want to keep an eye on VonC's answer here for updates on changes made to this feature in future updates."}]}

The difference arises when you're pushing more than one branch with a single git push.\nIn a nutshell, the optional + gives you finer control than -f does: if you're pushing more than one ref at a time, the + allows you to specify which of the pushed refs get force-pushed, whereas --force (or -f) applies to all the refs that are getting pushed.\nMore details\nWhat the git-push man page tells you\nThe most basic form of git push that involve one or more refspec(s) is\ngit push <repository> <refspec>...\n\nThe form that the <refspec>... argument must satisfy is described in the git-push man page thus:\n\n<refspec>...\nSpecify what destination ref to update with what source object. The\nformat of a `<refspec>` parameter is an optional plus `+`, followed by\nthe source object `<src>`, followed by a colon `:`, followed by the\ndestination ref `<dst>`.\n\n\nSo, just to be clear, the syntax for <refspec> is\n[+]<src>[:<dest>]\n\nIf :<dst> is omitted, the same ref as <src> will be updated... unless the remote.<repository>.push entry (if any) in your Git config says otherwise.\nFurther down in the git-push man page, you find\n\nBy having the optional leading +, you can tell Git to update the <dst>\n  ref even if it is not allowed by default (e.g., it is not a\n  fast-forward.) This does not attempt to merge <src> into <dst>.\n\nAnd still further down:\n\nNote that --force applies to all the refs that are pushed, hence\n  using it with push.default set to matching or with multiple push\n  destinations configured with remote.*.push may overwrite refs other\n  than the current branch (including local refs that are strictly behind\n  their remote counterpart). To force a push to only one branch, use a +\n  in front of the refspec to push (e.g git push origin +master to force\n  a push to the master branch).\n\nExample\nConsider a local repo with two branches, master and develop, which you want to push (with a single git push command) to an origin remote.\n\ngit push origin master develop will push both branches, but neither will get force-pushed.\ngit push origin +master develop will push both branches, but only master will get force-pushed. \ngit push origin master +develop , conversely, will push both branches, but only develop will get force-pushed.\ngit push origin +master +develop will force-push both branches. It's an exact equivalent to git push -f origin master develop."}]}

When you switch branches in your repo, you're not affecting that. The same is true for remote branches; you might have master and origin/master in your repo, where origin/master represents a local copy of the master branch in the remote repository. \norigin's HEAD will only change if you or someone else actually changes it in the remote repository, which should basically never happen - you want the default branch a public repo to stay constant, on the stable branch (probably master). origin/HEAD is a local ref representing a local copy of the HEAD in the remote repository. (Its full name is refs/remotes/origin/HEAD.)\nI think the above answers what you actually wanted to know, but to go ahead and answer the question you explicitly asked... origin/HEAD is set automatically when you clone a repository, and that's about it. Bizarrely, that it's not set by commands like git remote update - I believe the only way it will change is if you manually change it. (By change I mean point to a different branch; obviously the commit it points to changes if that branch changes, which might happen on fetch/pull/remote update.)\n\nEdit: The problem discussed below was corrected in Git 1.8.4.3; see this update.\n\nThere is a tiny caveat, though. HEAD is a symbolic ref, pointing to a branch instead of directly to a commit, but the git remote transfer protocols only report commits for refs. So Git knows the SHA1 of the commit pointed to by HEAD and all other refs; it then has to deduce the value of HEAD by finding a branch that points to the same commit. This means that if two branches happen to point there, it's ambiguous. (I believe it picks master if possible, then falls back to first alphabetically.) You'll see this reported in the output of git remote show origin:\n$ git remote show origin\n* remote origin\n  Fetch URL: ...\n  Push  URL: ...\n  HEAD branch (remote HEAD is ambiguous, may be one of the following):\n    foo\n    master\n\nOddly, although the notion of HEAD printed this way will change if things change on the remote (e.g. if foo is removed), it doesn't actually update refs/remotes/origin/HEAD. This can lead to really odd situations. Say that in the above example origin/HEAD actually pointed to foo, and origin's foo branch was then removed. We can then do this:\n$ git remote show origin\n...\nHEAD branch: master\n$ git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD\nrefs/remotes/origin/foo\n$ git remote update --prune origin\nFetching origin\n x [deleted]         (none)     -> origin/foo\n   (refs/remotes/origin/HEAD has become dangling)\n\nSo even though remote show knows HEAD is master, it doesn't update anything. The stale foo branch is correctly pruned, and HEAD becomes dangling (pointing to a nonexistent branch), and it still doesn't update it to point to master. If you want to fix this, use git remote set-head origin -a, which automatically determines origin's HEAD as above, and then actually sets origin/HEAD to point to the appropriate remote branch."}]}

Also, I know we can just push/pull from one to another, but we are required to have the code/repo on the share for back-up reasons.\nUpdate:\nMy worries are not about the possibility of a network failure. Even so, we would have the required branches locally, and we'll be able to compile our sources.\nBut, we usually commit quite often, and need to rebase/merge often. From my point of view, the best option would be to have a central repo on the share (so the backups are assured), and we would both clone from that one, and use it to rebase.\nBut, due to the fact we are doing this often, I am afraid about file/repo corruption, if it happens that we both push/pull at the same time. Normally, we could yell at each other each time we access the remote repo :), but it would be better to have it secured by the computers/network.\nAnd, it is possible that GIT has an internal mechanism to do this (since someone can push to one of your repos, while you work on it), but I haven't found anything conclusive yet.\nUpdate 2:\nThe repo on the share drive would be a bare repo, not containing a working copy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Git requires minimal file locking, which I believe is the main cause of problems when using this kind of shared resource over a network file system. The reason it can get away with this is that most of the files in a Git repo--- all the ones that form the object database--- are named as a digest of their content, and immutable once created. So there the problem of two clients trying to use the same file for different content doesn't come up.\nThe other part of the object database is trickier-- the refs are stored in files under the \"refs\" directory (or in \"packed-refs\") and these do change: although the refs/* files are small and always rewritten rather than being edited. In this case, Git writes the new ref to a temporary \".lock\" file and then renames it over the target file. If the filesystem respects O_EXCL semantics, that's safe. Even if not, the worst that could happen would be a race overwriting a ref file. Although this would be annoying to encounter, it should not cause corruption as such: it just might be the case that you push to the shared repo, and that push looks like it succeeded whereas in fact someone else's did. But this could be sorted out simply by pulling (merging in the other guy's commits) and pushing again.\nIn summary, I don't think that repo corruption is too much of a problem here--- it's true that things can go a bit wrong due to locking problems, but the design of the Git repo will minimise the damage.\n(Disclaimer: this all sounds good in theory, but I've not done any concurrent hammering of a repo to test it out, and only share them over NFS not CIFS)"}]}

Write down the id you will use in this step (see below) as you will need it in your pipeline declaration.\nFrom the Jenkins documentation\n\nTo add new global credentials to your Jenkins instance:\n\nIf required, ensure you are logged in to Jenkins (as a user with the Credentials > Create permission).\nFrom the Jenkins home page (i.e. the Dashboard of the Jenkins classic UI), click Credentials > System on the left.\nUnder System, click the Global credentials (unrestricted) link to access this default domain.\nClick Add Credentials on the left. Note: If there are no credentials in this default domain, you could also click the add some credentials link (which is the same as clicking the Add Credentials link).\nFrom the Kind field, choose the type of credentials to add.\nFrom the Scope field, choose either:\n  \n  \n\nGlobal - if the credential/s to be added is/are for a Pipeline project/item. Choosing this option applies the scope of the credential/s to the Pipeline project/item \"object\" and all its descendent objects.\nSystem - if the credential/s to be added is/are for the Jenkins instance itself to interact with system administration functions, such as email authentication, agent connection, etc. Choosing this option applies the scope of the credential/s to a single object only.\n\n\nAdd the credentials themselves into the appropriate fields for your chosen credential type:\n  \n  \n(...)\n\nUsername and password - specify the credential’s Username and Password in their respective fields.\n    (...)\n\n\nIn the ID field, specify a meaningful credential ID value - for example, jenkins-user-for-xyz-artifact-repository. You can use upper- or lower-case letters for the credential ID, as well as any valid separator character. However, for the benefit of all users on your Jenkins instance, it is best to use a single and consistent convention for specifying credential IDs. Note: This field is optional. If you do not specify its value, Jenkins assigns a globally unique ID (GUID) value for the credential ID. Bear in mind that once a credential ID is set, it can no longer be changed.\nSpecify an optional Description for the credential/s.\nClick OK to save the credentials.\n\n\nStep 3 - Use the credentials in your pipeline declaration\nYou can use the credentials in your jenkinsFile like so:\npipeline {\n  stages {\n    stage('Clone stage') {\n       steps {\n         git url: 'https://gitlab.com/[username]/[my-repo].git', branch: 'master', credentialsId: 'my-gitlab-repo-creds'\n       }\n    }\n  }    \n}\n\nIn the above example I assume you picked the id my-gitlab-repo-creds in step 2."}]}

However, I can't understand why it's awesome.\n\nHow do I use it?\nIs it just like svn blame?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The idea behind git bisect is to perform a binary search in the history to find a particular regression. Imagine that you have the following development history:\n... --- 0 --- 1 --- 2 --- 3 --- 4* --- 5 --- current\n\nYou know that your program is not working properly at the current revision, and that it was working at the revision 0. So the regression was likely introduced in one of the commits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, current.\nYou could try to check out each commit, build it, check if the regression is present or not. If there are a large number of commits, this can take a long time. This is a linear search. We can do better by doing a binary search. This is what the git bisect command does. At each step it tries to reduce the number of revisions that are potentially bad by half.\nYou'll use the command like this:\n$ git stash save\n$ git bisect start\n$ git bisect bad\n$ git bisect good 0\nBisecting: 2 revisions left to test after this (roughly 2 steps)\n[< ... sha ... >] 3\n\nAfter this command, git will checkout a commit. In our case, it'll be commit 3. You need to build your program, and check whether or not the regression is present. You'll also need to tell git the status of this revision with either git bisect bad if the regression is present, or git bisect good if it is not.\nLet's suppose that the regression was introduced in commit 4. Then the regression is not present in this revision, and we tell it to git.\n$ make\n$ make test\n... ... ...\n$ git bisect good\nBisecting: 0 revisions left to test after this (roughly 1 step)\n[< ... sha ... >] 5\n\nIt will then checkout another commit. Either 4 or 5 (as there are only two commits). Let's suppose it picked 5. After a build we test the program and see that the regression is present. We then tell it to git:\n$ make\n$ make test\n... ... ...\n$ git bisect bad\nBisecting: 0 revisions left to test after this (roughly 0 steps)\n[< ... sha ... >] 4\n\nWe test the last revision, 4. And since it is the one that introduced the regression, we tell it to git:\n$ make\n$ make test\n... ... ...\n$ git bisect bad\n< ... sha ... > is the first bad commit\n< ... commit message ... >\n\nIn this simple situation, we only had to test 3 versions (3, 4, 5) instead of 4 (1, 2, 3, 4). This is a small win, but this is because our history is so small. If the search range is of N commits, we should expect to test 1 + log2 N commits with git bisect instead of roughly N / 2 commits with a linear search.\nOnce you've found the commit that introduced the regression, you can study it to find the issue. Once this is done, you use git bisect reset to put everything back on the original state before using git bisect command."}]}

Despite my concern that the group he chose didn't seem to communicate well and wasn't asking enough questions to truly understand and be effective, we went with them anyway.\nWe set them up to collaborate on our Git repository (hosted on GitHub). We created a branch just for them (TheOutsourcedBranch, we'll call it) and requested that they to do all of their work within this branch.\nAdditionally, we asked that they push their commits at the end of each day so that we can get a decent idea of how fast they work and (more importantly) how good their code is.\nToday they pushed for the first time. Five commits, all of them in master. I'm trying to figure out how to move their commits from master into TheOutsourcedBranch, without losing the work they've done (although from the looks of it, we're going to have to throw it away anyway).\n\nOrange dots are their commits, gray dots are mine.\nI know there are a zillion questions about rebasing (and that might be what I need to do here) but I'm having a hard time figuring out which of them apply to my specific case. And in case it matters, the outsourcing group and myself are the only people that are really using the repo right now.\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit:\nI may have found what I'm looking for: Move the most recent commit(s) to a new branch with Git\nI'd like to check my understanding, though. Locally, I create a branch off of master (TheOutsourcedBranch), which would contain everything A-H. Then I reset master back to C. Master would now contain A-C.\nAssuming that is correct, that would be fine for me (locally). But then what do I need to do to \"force\" the remote repository (GitHub) to accept my local view of how things played out and discard its version of the history?\nOnce this has played out I think I can re-work this question to make it more generic/informative and cut out some fluff--otherwise it's probably a good candidate for deletion, I would guess."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Getting the branch is easy:\ngit branch their-branch master\ngit reset --hard master $SHA1_OF_C\ngit push --force $SHARED_REPO_REMOTE\n\nThis will rewrite history; it creates a new branch that is equivalent to the current master branch named their-branch, then resets your local master to point to a random SHA1 (...or branch, or tag, or whatever), and finally forcibly updates the remote repository branch to match your local branch.\nThat delivers exactly the situation you want.\nCaveats: this will rewrite history, and can screw up anyone who has built off the old master.  Watch out for merge problems following.\nNo rebasing desired or required.\n(As an aside, I suggest you either give them a staging repository, or get them to use git send-email, or use GitHub pull requests, or otherwise prevent them pushing to master until they get it right.

You've pushed and other people have your bad changes.\nYou want to undo it. It’s not something you can hand-undo in code yourself, say some wizard or package manager changed tons of stuff all over the place - you just want to put it all back how it was.\nThis is what source control is all about. I'm sure it’s easy.\nOkay, you're going to use git revert, but how?\nAnd after running git revert, do you have to do something else after?

Using git revert:\n$ git revert HEAD\n[master 1db4eeb] Revert \"bad update\"\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)\n\nThere will be 3 commits in the log:\n$ git log --oneline\n1db4eeb Revert \"bad update\"\na1b9870 bad update\n3f7522e initial commit\n\nSo there is a consistent history of what has happened, yet the files are as if the bad update never occured:\ncat README.md \nInitial text\n\nIt doesn't matter where in the history the commit to be reverted is (in the above example, the last commit is reverted - any commit can be reverted).\nClosing questions\n\ndo you have to do something else after?\n\nA git revert is just another commit, so e.g. push to the remote so that other users can pull/fetch/merge the changes and you're done.\n\nDo you have to commit the changes revert made or does revert directly commit to the repo?\n\ngit revert is a commit - there are no extra steps assuming reverting a single commit is what you wanted to do.\n\nObviously, you'll need to push again and probably announce your balls-up to the team.\n\nIndeed - if the remote is in an unstable state - communicating to the rest of the team that they need to pull to get the fix (the reverting commit) would be the right thing to do :)."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "git copy file, as opposed to `git mv`\nI realize that git works by diff'ing the contents of files. I have some files that I want to copy. To absolutely prevent git from ever getting confused, is there some git command that can be used to copy the files to a different directory (not mv, but cp), and stage the files as well?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The short answer is just \"no\".  But there is more to know; it just requires some background.  (And as JDB suggests in a comment, I'll mention why git mv exists as a convenience.)\nSlightly longer: you're right that Git will diff files, but you may be wrong about when Git does these file-diffs.\nGit's internal storage model proposes that each commit is an independent snapshot of all the files in that commit.  The version of each file that goes into the new commit, i.e., the data in the snapshot for that path, is whatever is in the index under that path at the time you run git commit.1\nThe actual implementation, to the first level, is that each snapshotted-file is captured in compressed form as a blob object in the Git database.  The blob object is quite independent of every previous and subsequent version of that file, except for one special case: if you make a new commit in which no data have changed, you will re-use the old blob.  So when you make two commits in a row, each of which holds 100 files, and only one file is changed, the second commit re-uses 99 previous blobs, and need only snapshot one actual file into a new blob.2\nHence the fact that Git will diff files doesn't enter into making commits at all.  No commit depends on a previous commit, other than to store the previous commit's hash ID (and perhaps to re-use exactly-matching blobs, but that's a side effect of them exactly matching, rather than a fancy computation at the time you run git commit).\nNow, all these independent blob objects do eventually take up an exorbitant amount of space.  At this point, Git can \"pack\" objects into a .pack file.  It will compare each object to some selected set of other objects—they may be earlier or later in history, and have the same file name or different file names, and in theory Git could even compress a commit object against a blob object or vice versa (though in practice it doesn't)—and try to find some way to represent many blobs using less disk space.  But the result is still, at least logically, a series of independent objects, retrieved completely intact in their original form using their hash IDs.  So even though the amount of disk space used goes down (we hope!) at this point, all of the objects are exactly the same as before.\nSo when does Git compare files?  The answer is: Only when you ask it to.  The \"ask time\" is when you run git diff, either directly:\ngit diff commit1 commit2\n\nor indirectly:\ngit show commit  # roughly, `git diff commit^@ commmit`\ngit log -p       # runs `git show commit`, more or less, on each commit\n\nThere are a bunch of subtleties about this—in particular, git show will produce what Git calls combined diffs when run on merge commits, while git log -p normally just skips right over the diffs for merge commits—but these, along with some other important cases, are when Git runs git diff.\nIt's when Git runs git diff that you can (sometimes) ask it to find, or not to find, copies.  The -C flag, also spelled --find-copies=<number>, asks Git to find copies.  The --find-copies-harder flag (which the Git documentation calls \"computationally expensive\") looks harder for copies than the plain -C flag.  The -B (break inappropriate pairings) option affects -C.  The -M aka --find-renames=<number> option also affects -C.  The git merge command can be told to adjust its level of rename detection, but—at least currently—cannot be told to find copies, nor break inappropriate pairings.\n(One command, git blame, does somewhat different copy-finding and the above does not entirely apply to it.)\n\n1If you run git commit --include <paths> or git commit --only <paths> or git commit <paths> or git commit -a, think of these as modifying the index before running git commit.  In the special case of --only, Git uses a temporary index, which is a little bit complicated, but it still commits from an index—it just uses the special temporary one instead of the normal one.  To make the temporary index, Git copies all the files from the HEAD commit, then overlays those with the --only files you listed.  For the other cases, Git just copies the work-tree files into the regular index, then goes on to make the commit from the index as usual.\n2In fact, the actual snapshotting, storing the blob into the repository, happens during git add.  This secretly makes git commit much faster, since you don't normally notice the extra time it takes to run git add before you fire up git commit.\n\nWhy git mv exists\nWhat git mv old new does is, very roughly:\nmv old new\ngit add new\ngit add old\n\nThe first step is obvious enough: we need to rename the work-tree version of the file.  The second step is similar: we need to put the index version of the file into place.  The third, though, is weird: why should we \"add\" a file we just removed?  Well, git add doesn't always add a file: instead, in this case it detects that the file was in the index and isn't anymore.\nWe could also spell that third step as:\ngit rm --cached old\n\nAll we're really doing is taking the old name out of the index.\nBut there's an issue here, which is why I said \"very roughly\".  The index has a copy of each file that will be committed the next time you run git commit.  That copy might not match the one in the work-tree.  In fact, it might not even match the one in HEAD, if there is one in HEAD at all.\nFor instance, after:\necho I am a foo > foo\ngit add foo\n\nthe file foo exists in the work-tree and in the index.  The work-tree contents and the index contents match.  But now let's change the work-tree version:\necho I am a bar > foo\n\nNow the index and work-tree differ.  Suppose we want to move the underlying file from foo to bar, but—for some strange reason3—we want to keep the index contents unchanged.  If we run:\nmv foo bar\ngit add bar\n\nwe'll get I am a bar inside the new index file.  If we then remove the old version of foo from the index, we lose the I am a foo version entirely.\nSo, git mv foo bar doesn't really move-and-add-twice, or move-add-and-remove.  Instead, it renames the work-tree file and renames the in-index copy.  If the index copy of the original file differs from the work-tree file, the renamed index copy still differs from the renamed work-tree copy.\nIt's very difficult to do this without a front end command like git mv.4  Of course, if you plan to git add everything, you don't need all of this stuff in the first place.  And, it's worth noting that if git cp existed, it probably should also copy the index version, not the work-tree version, when making the index copy.  So git cp really should exist.  There also should be a git mv --after option, a la Mercurial's hg mv --after.  Both should exist, but currently don't.  (There's less call for either of these, though, than there is for straight git mv, in my opinion.)\n\n3For this example, it's kind of silly and pointless.  But if you use git add -p to carefully prepare a patch for an intermediate commit, and then decide that along with the patch, you would like to rename the file, it's definitely handy to be able to do that without messing up your carefully-patched-together intermediate version.\n4It's not impossible: git ls-index --stage will get you the information you need from the index as it is right now, and git update-index allows you to make arbitrary changes to the index.  You can combine these two, and some complex shell scripting or programming in a nicer language, to build something that implements git mv --after and git cp."}]}

This file is committed into\n  the repo and overrides the core.autocrlf setting,\n  allowing you to ensure consistent behaviour for all\n  users regardless of their git settings.\n\nAnd thus\n\nThe advantage of this is that your end of line\n  configuration now travels with your repository and you\n  don't need to worry about whether or not collaborators\n  have the proper global settings.\n\nHere's an example of a .gitattributes file\n# Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization\n*        text=auto\n\n*.cs     text diff=csharp\n*.java   text diff=java\n*.html   text diff=html\n*.css    text\n*.js     text\n*.sql    text\n\n*.csproj text merge=union\n*.sln    text merge=union eol=crlf\n\n*.docx   diff=astextplain\n*.DOCX   diff=astextplain\n\n# absolute paths are ok, as are globs\n/**/postinst* text eol=lf\n\n# paths that don't start with / are treated relative to the .gitattributes folder\nrelative/path/*.txt text eol=lf\n\nThere is a convenient collection of ready to use .gitattributes files for the most popular programming languages. It's useful to get you started.\nOnce you've created or adjusted your .gitattributes, you should perform a once-and-for-all line endings re-normalization.\nNote that the GitHub Desktop app can suggest and create a .gitattributes file after you open your project's Git repo in the app. To try that, click the gear icon (in the upper right corner) > Repository settings ... > Line endings and attributes. You will be asked to add the recommended .gitattributes and if you agree, the app will also perform a normalization of all the files in your repository.\nFinally, the Mind the End of Your Line article\nprovides more background and explains how Git has evolved\non the matters at hand. I consider this required reading.\nYou've probably got users in your team who use EGit or JGit (tools like Eclipse and TeamCity use them) to commit their changes. Then you're out of luck, as @gatinueta explained in this answer's comments:\n\nThis setting will not satisfy you completely if you have people working with Egit or JGit in your team, since those tools will just ignore .gitattributes and happily check in CRLF files https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=342372\n\nOne trick might be to have them commit their changes in another client, say SourceTree. Our team back then preferred that tool to Eclipse's EGit for many use cases.\nWho said software is easy? :-/"}]}

By default, Git will refuse to even parse a Git\nconfig of a repository owned by someone else, let alone run its\nhooks, and this config setting allows users to specify exceptions,\ne.g. for intentionally shared repositories (see the --shared option in git-init ). This is a multi-valued setting, i.e. you can add more than one directory\nvia git config --add . To reset the list of safe directories (e.g. to\noverride any such directories specified in the system config), add a safe.directory entry with an empty value. This config setting is only respected in protected configuration (see SCOPES ). This prevents untrusted repositories from tampering with this\nvalue. The value of this setting is interpolated, i.e. ~/<path> expands to a\npath relative to the home directory and %(prefix)/<path> expands to a\npath relative to Git’s (runtime) prefix. To completely opt-out of this security check, set safe.directory to the\nstring * . This will allow all repositories to be treated as if their\ndirectory was listed in the safe.directory list. If safe.directory=* is set in system config and you want to re-enable this protection, then\ninitialize your list with an empty value before listing the repositories\nthat you deem safe. As explained, Git only allows you to access repositories owned by\nyourself, i.e. the user who is running Git, by default.  When Git\nis running as root in a non Windows platform that provides sudo,\nhowever, git checks the SUDO_UID environment variable that sudo creates\nand will allow access to the uid recorded as its value in addition to\nthe id from root .\nThis is to make it easy to perform a common sequence during installation\n\"make && sudo make install\".  A git process running under sudo runs as root but the sudo command exports the environment variable to record\nwhich id the original user has.\nIf that is not what you would prefer and want git to only trust\nrepositories that are owned by root instead, then you can remove\nthe SUDO_UID variable from root’s environment before invoking git."}]}

Either way, I was thinking of using Google Code and SVN to share the source code of my projects instead of providing a link to the source on my website. This has always been a pain because I had to update the binaries and the code every time I released a new version. This would also help me to have a backup of my code some where instead of just my local machine (I used to have a local Subversion server running).\nWhat I want from a service like this is very simple... I just want a place to store my source code that people can download if they want, that allows me to control revisions and provide a simple and easy issue/bug system so people can submit bugs and stuff like that. I guess both of them have this.\nBut I don't want to host any binaries in their websites. I want this to be hosted on my website so I can control download statistics with my own scripts. I also don't have a need for wiki pages as I prefer to have all the documentation on my own website. Do any of these services provide a way to \"disable\" features like wiki and downloads and not show them at all for my project(s)?\nNow, I'm sure there are lots of pros and cons about using Google Code with SVN and GitHub with Git (of course) but here's what's important for me on each one, and why I like them:\nGoogle Code:\n\nAs with any Google page, the complexity is almost non-existent\nEveryone (or almost everyone) has a Google account, whcih is nice if people want to report problems using the issues system\n\nGitHub:\n\nMay (or may not) be a little more complex (not a problem for me though) than Google's pages but...\n...has a much prettier interface than Google's service\nIt needs people to be registered on GitHub to post about issues\nI like the fact that with Git, you have your own revisions locally (can I use TortoiseGit for this or?)\n\nBasically that's it. Not much, I know...\nWhat other common pros and cons can you tell me about each site/software? Keep in mind that my projects are simple, I'm probably the only one who will ever develop these projects on these repositories (or maybe not, but for now I am)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Google Code is supporting Mercurial now.

Maybe it's just me, but the documentation could be more lucid:\nhttp://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files\nMoreover, a lot of the commentary on this subject seems to use the words \"indexed\", \"committed\", \"tracked\" somewhat loosely, which makes the differences between these three less clear.\nMy current (admittedly limited) understanding:\n\nFiles matched in .gitignore will not be tracked in the future.\n(Though they may have been tracked previously.) This means that they\nwon't ever show up in a future git status list as changed.\nHowever, future changes will still be synced with remote repos. In other words, the files are still \"indexed\", but they are not \"tracked\".\nBecause a .gitignore file is in the project directory, the file\nitself can be versioned.\n\nFiles matched in .git/info/exclude will also not be \"tracked\".

However, the last version of the file to be committed before assume-unchanged will remain visible to all users in the repo.\n\n\nMy questions:\n\nIs the above interpretation correct? Please correct me.\n\nIf a file has already been in a commit, what is the functional\ndifferent between matching it in .exclude and running\nassume-unchanged on it? Why would one prefer one approach to\nanother?\n\nMy basic use case is that I want to avoid sorting through diffs on\ncompiled files, but I still want those compiled files synced along\nwith the source files.

In-tree .gitignore are to be shared among project\nmembers (i.e. everybody working on the project should consider the\npaths that match the ignore pattern in there as cruft).  On the other\nhand, .git/info/exclude is meant for personal ignore patterns (i.e.\nyou, while working on the project, consider them as cruft).\nAssume-unchanged should not be abused for an ignore mechanism. It is,\n\"I know my filesystem operations are slow.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Git Workflows: Rebasing Published/Shared Branches\nOur team at work has enthusiastically adopted a rebase workflow, but we might have gotten a little carried away, which is the point of this question: you be the judge.\nUsing pull --rebase is a no-brainer to me now.  However, we also have large feature branches that multiple people work on.  Periodically, we want to bring in changes that are happening on master.  Conventional wisdom would have us merge since it's a shared branch.  However, in our rebase-obsession, we've decided to rebase those branches.  Of course that requires everyone's cooperation.  The workflow goes something like this:\n1) The rebaser coordinates with everyone to make sure they're all checked-in and pushed on the feature branch, then asks them to do no more work on that branch until they get the all clear.\n2) The rebaser rebases the feature branch onto master, deletes the remote feature branch (git push origin :feature), and then pushes the new, rebased feature branch (git push origin feature)\n3) The rebaser has everyone fetch, which updates their feature branch, then delete their local feature branch (git branch -D feature), then create a new local feature branch that tracks the remote feature branch.  Everyone then gets the all-clear.\nThis workflow is working, partially because we're a small group, and the work interruptions are small.  However, I worry that we're learning poor Git habits (rebasing a shared branch), or that the workflow won't scale well.\nOn the upside, our repository history is lovely.\nWhat do you think, Git gurus?  Are we playing with fire, or rocking a reasonable workflow?\nUPDATE:\nIt's two years since I originally asked the question, and my has our workflow changed since then.  We still routinely do git pull --rebase, so that hasn't changed.  It's common sense, and it prevents all the unsightly, confusing mini-merges.  (We keep mostly in sync, so there's little cost to git pull --rebase).\nOther than that, however, and the occasional heroic action to correct a mistake, we are over our rebase madness.  Merging makes sense most of the time.  However, wanton merging is problematic, and does contribute to the confusing, chaotic history I was concerned about two years ago.\nOur solution has several components:\n\nThe master branch is \"pristine\".  Topic branches get merged in, and once they do, the topic branch is retired.  In other words, merging a topic branch in signifies that that work is ready for production, and is now part of the master branch.  Looking at our version history, it's very clear what's happening: topic branches getting merged into master, and that's that.\nWe use disposable integration branches when necessary.  For example, if we have topic branches A, B, and C, and none of them are ready for integration into master, but we need to test them together, we just create a QA branch (usually off of master), and then merge A, B, and C in.  At some point, the QA branch is deleted or re-used.  The point is that it's not intended to be permanent in any way, and it doesn't have the same restrictions as the master branch (you can merge in your topic branches as many times as you want).  If the history gets too confusing, you can just delete the QA branch and start fresh (an approach we have found to be very natural).\nWhen merging, always use git merge --no-ff.  This is such a tremendous reversal from our \"linear commit history\" obsession from two years ago that it deserves comment.  Now that we've relaxed about a linear commit history, and seen that merges are good and useful, we've started to rely on topic branches being actual branches off of master, not just a series of commits that eventually becomes one with master.  git merge --no-ff ensures there's always a merge commit, even when it's not necessary.\nWe have a well-understood convention for commit messages and branches and, more importantly, it cross-references our issue-tracking system.  Our issue tracking system uses numeric issue numbers, and for any feature (or defect), we have an issue number (1234, for example).  If you're working on that issue, you would create a branch _1234 and start every commit message with \"_1234: doing blah blah\".  It may seem a little obsessive, but it has really worked well for us, and significantly reduced/eliminated confusion.\nUse a git wrapper to encourage workflow adhesion.  This is something we're currently working on, but we've realized is entirely necessary to prevent simple and understandable mistakes, like branching off of the wrong thing (we recently had a complete disaster when a developer created a topic branch off of a disposable QA branch: that topic branch was approved to go live, it was merged in...and a bunch of changers that weren't approved to go live were sucked in).  Our git wrapper will require confirmation whenever you do something unusual (like creating a branch off of anything but master, creating a branch not named _NNNN, making a commit that doesn't start with _NNNN, etc.).  Occasionally, we do need to do these things, so the wrapper doesn't prevent it, but it does keep people from accidentally doing something they shouldn't."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This sounds like it's overly complicated and won't scale well. It's probably a heck of a lot simpler just to merge master into your feature branch periodically, and then when it comes time to merge back into master, then you can do the rebase first (to remove the intermediate unnecessary merge) and merge back into master (presumably with --no-ff to produce a merge commit). This only requires one person deal with the rebase, and they don't have to do any coordination because nobody else needs to force-update anything (because, presumably, the branch is going to be deleted after it's merged, rather than kept around in a rewritten state). You may also decide to skip the rebase entirely and just leave the intermediate merges in place, which would more accurately reflect your development workflow and remove the risk of producing commits that don't actually build."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How to have a Gitlab CI Pipeline run some jobs always and other jobs only on merge-requests?\n\nTL/DR: \nMy goal is to have a Gitlab (CE-12.4.2) pipeline that executes some jobs only on merge-requests and other jobs always (on merge-requests and on all normal pushes). How must the .gitlab-ci.yml look to do this?\nMy use-case: \nI have a big pipeline running a lot of jobs (tests, validation, dep's, build, doc's, ...). Now I have added a staging environment (using kubernetes) and have the pipeline build a new image and deploy that in the staging-environment. This allows me to instantly open up the changed (web-)application and see how the changes behave and look without having to check them out locally. Now building an image and deploying it to staging would be much too resource-heavy to do for every push, so I only want deployments to staging when someone creates a merge-request for me to review.\nA very simplified example:\ninstall:\n  script: ...\n\ntest:\n  script: ...\n\nbuild-image:\n  script: ...\n  only: [merge_requests]\n\ndeploy-staging:\n  script: ...\n  only: [merge_requests]\n\nFor all normal pushes, the jobs install and test should be executed.\nFor merge-requests, the jobs install, test, build-image and deploy-staging should be executed.\nWhat i have tried: Gitlab has this feature to define only: [merge_requests] on a job, this causes that job to only be executed when the pipeline is executed for a merge-request. Sounds like exactly what I am looking for, but there is a big catch. Once that attribute is applied to one job in a pipeline, all other jobs in that pipeline that do not have that attribute will be removed from the pipeline when executed inside merge-requests. That seemed like a bug to me at first, but is actually documented behaviour:\nIn the above example, the pipeline contains only a test job. Since the build and deploy jobs don’t have the only: [merge_requests] parameter, they will not run in the merge request.\n\nIn order to re-introduce all the other jobs to the pipeline for merge-requests, I have to apply only: [merge_requests] to all other jobs. The problem with that approach is that now these regular jobs do not get executed for normal git-pushes anymore. And I have no way to re-introduce these regular jobs to pipelines for normal pushes, because Gitlab has no support for only: [always] or anything like that.\nNow I also have noticed that the only syntax is candidate for deprecation and one should prefer the rules syntax instead, so I took a look at that. There are multiple problems with that approach: \n\nThe only way to detect with rules whether the pipeline is executed for a merge-request or not is to evaluate the variables related to merge-requests, like $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_ID. Unfortunately these variables only exist when only: [merge_requests] is used, which would re-introduce the above problems.\nRules only allow the conditional application of other attributes, so I still would have to use only, except or when attributes to actually remove or add jobs from or to the pipeline. Unfortunately Gitlab does not support anything like only: [never] or when: never, so i have no way to actually remove or add the jobs.\n\nI also tried to have the jobs depend on another using need or dependencies attributes, this seemed to have no effect on whether the job is included to the pipeline or not.\nThe last thing I desperately tried was including all jobs always and just mark them as when: manual to be triggered manually by pushing a button. This somewhat works, but is very tedious because the deployment to staging is a multi-job process with every job taking quite some time to finish. So I would see a merge-request, push the button for the first job, wait 5 minutes, press the next button, wait 5 minutes again, and only then am able to use the staging. For many small merge-requests, this would take up a lot of my time and would not be a efficient solution. I also cannot just mark the first of these jobs as manual because Gitlab will then just skip that job and execute that later ones out of order (And again, needs and dependencies seem to have no effect on this when dealing with manually triggered jobs).\nWhat i am a bit baffled about is that after searching the net, I have found nobody having the same problem. Either I am the only Gitlab User that wants to execute some jobs only for merge-requests without excluding all other jobs (which seems highly unlikely) or I am missing something obvious (which seems more likely). Am I missing something or does Gitlab really not support this use-case?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "From the previous answer:\n\nBut there is a problem.

I have no idea if that's significant, but it leads me to believe that the new tag object isn't quite what I want. I can live with that, because I really only care that the tag name matches the documentation, but I'd rather do it \"right\", assuming there is a right way to do this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is how I rename a lightweight tag old to new:\ngit tag new old           # Create a new local tag named `new` from tag `old`.\ngit tag -d old            # Delete local tag `old`.\ngit push origin new :old  # Push `new` to your remote named \"origin\", and delete\n                          #     tag `old` on origin (by pushing an empty tag\n                          #     name to it).\n\nThe colon in the push command removes the tag from the remote repository.

Please tell\nthem (co-workers) to run the following command:\ngit fetch --prune --prune-tags\n\nNote that if you are renaming an annotated tag, you need to ensure that the new tag name is referencing the underlying commit and not the old annotated tag object that you're about to delete. If the old tag is an annotated tag, or you aren't sure, you can use ^{} to dereference the object until a non-tag object is found:\n# create a new annotated tag \"new\" referencing the object\n# which the old annotated tag \"old\" was referencing:\ngit tag -a new old^{}"}]}
